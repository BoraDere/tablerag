Five men came out and tried to drive it away. The wolf charged at Diamond Jenness after he threw a rock and missed. Jenness grabbed the wolf by the back of the neck, but the wolf turned its head enough to severely bite his forearm. He choked the wolf with his other hand; it released, stepped back, and was shot by another man. The wound was treated and eventually fully healed, but Jenness never contracted rabies despite consistency of the wolf’s behavior with the early stages of the disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                      |\n| Mike Dusiac, Railwayman                                |         | ♂        | December 29, 1942       | Possibly rabid                | Poulin, Ontario, Canada                                                                       | Riding a small rail vehicle called a speeder when a wolf leaped at him and bit his sleeve, knocking him down and knocking the vehicle off the track. Dusiac kept the wolf at bay for more than 25 minutes with an ax. He managed to hit the wolf repeatedly but not squarely enough. The wolf was not deterred by an approaching train which stopped to help Dusiac. Several railwaymen came running, but the wolf would not retreat. The men killed the wolf with picks and shovels. The carcass was inspected by a biologist, and it appeared healthy. However, Rutter and Pimlot reviewed the case in 1968 and concluded that it must have been rabid because of the sustained and determined nature of the attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                      |\n| Zacarias Hugo                                          | 14      | ♂        | 1943                    | Possibly rabid                | Etivluk River, Alaska, USA                                                                    | While hunting caribou, Zacarias heard a sound, turned and saw a large black wolf coming for him. It knocked him down and bit his arm, so he could not use his rifle. It bit his legs, back, arm and neck and dragged him 18 metres before abandoning the attack and disappearing. He walked back to camp, but had lost a lot of blood, mostly from his forearm. His caribou skin Anorak protected him from greater injury or even death, but may have contributed to the attack if it caused the wolf to mistake him for a caribou. This attack had long been classified as \"rabid\" because it occurred during an epizootic of the disease in that area and because Zac's father, Inualuruk, tracked the wolf and observed to have been walking at times in the splayed manner of a sick animal.

While working near the running blades of the helicopter, Mulders saw a wolf approaching. Both men stood, shouted, and waved their arms. When mulders stepped toward the wolf, it started circling and stalking, then rushed in and bit down on Mulders' lower leg and would not let go despite repeated punches by Mulders for 10–15 seconds until the other biologist, Mark Williams, knocked the wolf unconscious with the caribou radio collar.

When the wolf hit the trail it turned and ran directly at him, maintaining eye contact, ears forward. He yelled and waved his arms, and the wolf put its ears back but kept running and eye contact. At close range Andy was able to fire his weapon. The bullet missed, but the muzzle blast pushed the wolf off line, and the wolf missed. He swung the rifle and hit the wolf's skull; staggered, it ran off. Rabies was not suspected because the animal quickly gave up and ran away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                      |\n| Park visitor                                           |         | ♂        | June, 1999              | Agonistic                     | Vargas Island Provincial Park, British Columbia, Canada                                       | At about 2am, a wolf began dragging a sleeping man in a sleeping bag. The wolf had moved the man several meters away from the campfire when the man awoke, sat up, and shouted. The wolf stopped, stepped back, and attacked at the midsection, still encased in the sleeping bag. He fought it with his hands and arms, and rolled back towards the fire pit. The wolf bit him on the back and head, leaving multiple lacerations and separating a part of his scalp from the skull before being chased away by a group of other campers. The attack lasted about five minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                      |\n|                                                        |         |          |                         |                               |                                                                                               | The man was transported to hospital in Victoria, BC, where his scalp flap was reattached with 50 stitches, and wounds to his hands and back were treated.

It includes victim details such as age and gender, the date of the incident, the type of attack (e.g., predatory, agonistic), the location, and specific details about each encounter. The purpose of the table is to document and analyze the nature of wolf interactions with humans, highlighting the circumstances surrounding each attack and the responses from the victims or bystanders.\n\n**Data Patterns and Trends**: The table reveals several patterns in wolf attack incidents over the years. Notably, many attacks occur in remote areas during activities like hunting or camping, often involving young victims or individuals perceived as vulnerable. There is a mix of predatory and agonistic attacks, with some incidents indicating possible rabid behavior in wolves. Several accounts show a trend of habituation, where wolves become more comfortable around humans, leading to aggressive encounters. The data also suggests that many attacks resulted in injuries but not fatalities, with various responses from the victims, including defensive actions and successful interventions by others. The documentation indicates a gradual change in human-wolf interactions, with increasing concerns about habituated wolves posing threats to humans.\nterms_explanation: ### Term Explanations for Wolf Attack Incidents Table\n\n**1.

The instructions for the event were modified by October 1, and no longer included the religious restrictions. A spokesperson for the AOC was quoted as saying the previous instruction contained “old information,” and that “is no longer the position of the agency.” |\n|   2008 | Subalpine Fir        | 70 feet (21 m)  | Bitterroot National Forest                       | Montana        | The tree was decorated with more than 5,000 ornaments displaying the theme \"Sharing Montana's Treasures\" by shocasing the state's heritage, historical events, and natural resources.

Deaths, and Population Changes from 1900 to 2013\n\n**Keywords**: Average population, live births, deaths, natural change, crude birth rate, crude death rate, fertility rates, historical demographics\n\n**Content Overview**: This table presents demographic data spanning from the year 1900 to 2013, detailing various metrics such as average population (in thousands), live births, deaths, natural population change, crude birth and death rates (per 1000 individuals), and fertility rates. The data is organized chronologically, allowing for an analysis of trends over time. The last row for 2013 shows fertility rates but lacks complete data for other metrics, indicating a potential gap in the dataset for that year.\n\n**Data Patterns and Trends**: The table reveals several significant trends in demographic changes over the years. Initially, there is a high crude birth rate and a relatively low crude death rate, leading to a natural increase in population. However, from the mid-20th century onwards, both birth and death rates show a gradual decline. The fertility rates also exhibit a downward trend, particularly noticeable from the 1980s onwards, suggesting changing societal norms regarding family size. The data indicates fluctuations in natural change, with notable declines during periods of higher mortality, such as during the war years. The last few decades show a stabilization of the population growth, with a consistent but low natural increase, reflecting broader demographic shifts towards lower fertility and aging populations.\nterms_explanation: **Term Explanations**:\n\n**1.

It lists the film type, specific format (such as 16 mm, 8 mm, 35 mm, etc.), ASA ratings (which indicate sensitivity to light), and the production dates for each film variant. This data serves to document the evolution and specifications of color films over several decades.\n\n**Data Patterns and Trends**: The table reveals a clear progression in film technology and sensitivity ratings over time. Early Kodachrome films, such as those produced in the 1930s, had lower ASA ratings (e.g., ASA 10), while later variants, particularly from the 1970s and 1980s, showcased higher sensitivity (e.g., ASA 64 and ASA 200). Additionally, the introduction of formats like Super 8 and professional-grade films indicates a diversification in film types catering to both amateur and professional markets. The data also highlights the longevity of certain film types, such as Kodachrome 25 and Kodachrome 64, which remained in production for several decades, reflecting their popularity and reliability.\nterms_explanation: **Term Explanations**:\n\n**1.

The table serves to illustrate the lifespan and longevity of U.S. presidents post-presidency and their respective ages during their time as the oldest living president.\n\n**Data Patterns and Trends**: The data reveals a trend of increasing longevity among U.S. presidents over time, with more recent presidents living significantly longer than their early counterparts. For instance, Ronald Reagan lived to be 93 years old, while earlier presidents such as George Washington and John Adams had much shorter lifespans post-presidency. The longest duration of being the oldest living president is held by Herbert Hoover, who maintained the title for 31 years, while presidents like Theodore Roosevelt had a much shorter span of only 253 days. The table also indicates that George H. W. Bush is currently the oldest living president, having held the title since December 26, 2006.\nterms_explanation: **Term Explanations**:\n\n**1.

Each entry includes the fence number, horse name, jockey's name, age of the horse, handicap weight (in stone and pounds), starting price (odds), and the fate of the horse during the race. The table serves to summarize the performance outcomes of each horse, categorizing them based on their finishing status.\n\n**Data Patterns and Trends**: The table indicates that all horses listed fell during the race, except for a few that were pulled up or brought down. The ages of the horses range from 7 to 14 years, with a majority having a handicap of 10-13 st-lb. The starting prices vary significantly, from as low as 22/1 to as high as 100/1, suggesting a mix of favorites and long shots in the race. Notably, the presence of multiple entries with the same fate (e.g., \"Fell\") suggests a challenging racecourse or conditions that affected many competitors similarly. Additionally, the repeated occurrence of \"Pulled Up\" and \"Brought Down\" indicates that some horses may have faced issues that led to their early withdrawal from the race.\nterms_explanation: ### Term Explanations for the Racing Event Outcomes and Jockey Performance Summary Table\n\n**1.

County and Zip Code Information\n\n**Keywords**: Place name, number of counties, principal county, lower zip code, upper zip code\n\n**Content Overview**: This table presents a detailed compilation of various places in Pennsylvania, listing the name of each place alongside the number of counties it is associated with, the principal county, and corresponding zip codes (both lower and upper where applicable). The structure includes columns for the place name, the number of counties, the principal county, and the zip code range, which provides essential geographical and administrative information useful for demographic studies, postal services, and regional planning.\n\n**Data Patterns and Trends**: The table indicates that most places are associated with a single county, as shown by the \"1\" in the \"Number of counties\" column. However, there are a few instances, such as \"Schuyler\" and \"Seven Springs,\" where places are linked to two counties. The data also reveals that certain counties, like Allegheny, Westmoreland, and Cambria, have multiple associated places, indicating a higher density of settlements in these areas. Additionally, many entries do not have an upper zip code listed, suggesting that these places may not have a defined upper limit for postal services or that the information is simply not provided.\nterms_explanation: ### Term Explanations for Pennsylvania Places Table\n\n**1.

Specifications, licensing model, processor chip limit, memory limit, user limit, virtualization rights, server roles, Active Directory services\n\n**Content Overview**: This table presents a detailed comparison of server specifications across four different categories: Foundation, Essentials, Standard, and Datacenter. Each category includes various specifications such as licensing model, processor chip limit, memory limit, user limit, and limits on services like Remote Desktop and network policies. The table is structured to allow for easy comparison of features and limitations associated with each server configuration.\n\n**Data Patterns and Trends**: The table shows a clear trend where the Datacenter category offers the most extensive capabilities, including unlimited user limits and service connections, as well as the highest memory and processor chip limits. In contrast, the Foundation category has the most restrictive limits, especially in terms of user connections and virtualization rights. Notably, while all categories support essential server roles like DHCP and DNS, the Standard and Datacenter categories allow for more extensive virtualization rights, with the Datacenter category permitting unlimited virtual machines. This highlights the progressive enhancement of features as one moves from Foundation to Datacenter.\nterms_explanation: ### Term Explanations for Server Specifications and Licensing Models\n\n**1.

Each entry includes a unique identifier (#), the name of the massif or reserve, the corresponding region, the type of nature reserve, the area preserved (in hectares), and the size of the buffer zone surrounding each reserve. The data highlights the extent of conservation efforts in these regions.\n\n**Data Patterns and Trends**: The table indicates a concentration of nature reserves in the Zakarpattia region, all categorized under the Carpathian Biosphere Reserve, showcasing significant preserved areas ranging from 1,369.6 ha to 11,860 ha. The buffer zones for these reserves are also substantial, with some exceeding 12,000 ha. In contrast, the Presov region features a mix of preserved areas with varying sizes, indicating a diverse approach to conservation. The reserves in Germany, such as Jasmund and Müritz National Parks, also show considerable preserved areas, though generally smaller than those in the Carpathian region. Overall, the data reflects a strong commitment to nature conservation across different regions, with varying scales of protected areas and buffer zones.\nterms_explanation: **Term Explanations**:\n\n**1.
