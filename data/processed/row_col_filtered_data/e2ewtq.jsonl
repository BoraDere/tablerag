The key fields include average population (in thousands), live births, deaths, natural change (the difference between births and deaths), crude birth rate (births per 1000 people), crude death rate (deaths per 1000 people), and fertility rates. The table allows for the analysis of population dynamics, fertility trends, and mortality rates over time.\n\n**Data Patterns and Trends**: The data reveals several notable trends:\n- A general increase in average population from 18,520 in 1900 to 46,818 in 2012, indicating significant population growth over the century.\n- The crude birth rate peaked in the early 1900s, with a gradual decline observed towards the end of the 20th century, reflecting changing societal norms and family planning practices.\n- Death rates have shown a declining trend from the early 1900s, particularly after the mid-20th century, likely due to advancements in healthcare and living conditions.\n- Natural change fluctuated significantly, with some years, especially during the early 1900s, showing high natural increases, while 1918 marked a notable decline due to increased deaths, possibly linked to the influenza pandemic.\n- Fertility rates generally decreased over the decades, reaching a low of 1.29 by 2013, indicating a shift towards smaller family sizes and possibly improved access to contraception and education for women.\n\nOverall, the table encapsulates the demographic transition experienced over more than a century, highlighting shifts in birth and death rates and the implications for population growth.", "formatted_table": {"header": ["", "Average population (x 1000)", "Live

This table serves as a reference for identifying places within the state and their corresponding administrative divisions.\n\n**Data Patterns and Trends**: The table reveals that most entries consist of unique places that are primarily associated with a single county, with each place listed just once under its respective county. A few places, such as \"Saco\" and \"Sadsbury Township,\" appear multiple times, indicating they may be relevant to different contexts or administrative divisions. Additionally, many entries lack an upper zip code, suggesting that not all places have a defined upper zip code range.
