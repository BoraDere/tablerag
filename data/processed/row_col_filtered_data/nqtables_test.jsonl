Each row details the election year, the winning candidate and their vote count along with the percentage of votes received, the losing candidate with their corresponding vote count and percentage, any other national candidates, their votes and percentages, the total electoral votes awarded, and additional notes where applicable. The data illustrates the electoral dynamics and shifts in voter preferences over time in Nebraska.\n\n**Data Patterns and Trends**: The table reveals several notable trends in Nebraska's voting behavior. For instance, Republican candidates have historically dominated the state, winning the majority of elections, particularly in recent decades. The highest percentage of votes for a candidate was achieved by Ronald Reagan in 1984 with 70.55%. Conversely, the lowest percentage of votes for a winning candidate was recorded by Grover Cleveland in 1892 with just 12.46%. The presence of third-party candidates, such as Ross Perot in the 1996 and 1992 elections, indicates moments of significant voter fragmentation.
