In the United Kingdom, a scheduled monument is a nationally important archaeological site or historic building that has been given protection against unauthorised change by being placed on a list (or schedule) by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport; English Heritage takes the leading role in identifying such sites. Scheduled monuments are defined in the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 and the National Heritage Act 1983. They are also referred to as scheduled ancient monuments. There are about 18,300 scheduled monument entries on the list, which is maintained by English Heritage; more than one site can be included in a single entry. While a scheduled monument can also be recognised as a listed building, English Heritage considers listed building status as a better way of protecting buildings than scheduled monument status. If a monument is considered by English Heritage to no longer merit scheduling it can be descheduled. The metropolitan county of Greater Manchester is composed of 10 metropolitan boroughs: Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan. Rochdale has no scheduled monuments; those in the other boroughs are listed separately. They range from prehistoric structures - the oldest of which date from the Bronze Age - to more modern structures such as the Astley Green Colliery, from 1908. Greater Manchester has seven prehistoric monuments (i.e. Bronze or Iron Age), found in Bury, Oldham, Salford, Stockport, and Tameside. passages: Wigan: Wigan is the largest settlement in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan and is its administrative centre .

In country areas, district high schools serve as both primary and junior high schools, with students generally commuting to or boarding at larger towns to finish the last two years of their education. passages: All Saints' College, Perth: All Saints ' College is an independent Anglican co-educational early learning , primary , and secondary day school , located in Bull Creek , a southern suburb of Perth , Western Australia .

Endorsements of statesmen and celebrities are also important to candidates. Late in the Republican race cycle, Romney toured Israel and Poland after a visit to the London 2012 Olympics. He received the endorsement of former President of Poland Lech Wałęsa, and soon after, the endorsement of actor and Second Amendment proponent Clint Eastwood. The winning of endorsements, also known as the Endorsement Race or Endorsement Derby, is argued to be a vital feature of the United States presidential race and the political party system.

Light at these wavelengths is absorbed by the Earth 's atmosphere , so observations at these wavelengths must be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space . [ 104 ] Objects emitting ultraviolet radiation include the Sun , other stars and galaxies . [ 105 ] | This list of space telescopes (astronomical space observatories) is grouped by major frequency ranges: gamma ray, x-ray, ultraviolet, visible, infrared, microwave and radio. Telescopes that work in multiple frequency bands are included in all of the appropriate sections. Space telescopes that collect particles, such as cosmic ray nuclei and/or electrons, as well as instruments that aim to detect gravitational waves, are also listed. Missions with specific targets within the Solar System (e.g. our Sun and its planets), are excluded; see List of Solar System probes for these, and List of Earth observation satellites for missions targeting our planet. Two values are provided for the dimensions of the initial orbit. For telescopes in Earth orbit, the min and max altitude are given in kilometers. For telescopes in solar orbit, the minimum distance (periapsis) and the maximum distance (apoapsis) between the telescope and the center of mass of the sun are given in astronomical units (AU). passages: Astronomical Netherlands Satellite: It was launched into Earth orbit on 30 August 1974 at 14:07:39 UTC in a Scout rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base , United States .

There are 26 National Historic Sites in Ottawa, of which two (Laurier House and the Rideau Canal) are administered by Parks Canada (identified below by the beaver icon ). The Rideau Canal, which extends to Lake Ontario at Kingston, was designated in 1925 and was the first site designated in Ottawa. There are six other National Historic Sites located within the National Capital Region, but not within Ottawa proper: the Former Almonte Post Office and Rosamond Woollen Mill in Almonte, the Gillies Grove and House in Arnprior, the Manoir Papineau in Montebello, the Symmes Hotel in the Aylmer sector of Gatineau, and the First Geodetic Survey Station in Chelsea. Numerous National Historic Events also occurred in Ottawa, and are identified at places associated with them, using the same style of federal plaque which marks National Historic Sites. Several National Historic Persons are commemorated throughout the city in the same way. The markers do not indicate which designation - a Site, Event, or Person - a subject has been given. National Historic Sites located elsewhere in Ontario are listed at National Historic Sites in Ontario. This list uses names designated by the national Historic Sites and Monuments Board, which may differ from other names for these sites. passages: ", "label": "37"}

At the top of the Norwegian football league system, it is the country's primary football competition. Contested by 16 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the 1. divisjon. Seasons run from March to November with each team playing 30 matches (playing each other home and away). Most games are played on Sunday evenings. Eliteserien was founded in 1937 as Norgesserien (English: The League of Norway), and the first season was the 1937-38 season. The structure and organisation of Eliteserien along with Norway's other football leagues have undergone frequent changes right up to the present day. Starting with the 2017 season the league is called Eliteserien after NFF decided to totally drop the sponsor name from the name of the league after the 2016 season. The broadcasting rights were in December 2015 secured by Discovery Networks who signed a six-year deal giving them rights to broadcast all the 240 games in Eliteserien from 2017 to 2023. The deal was worth NOK 2.4 billion. The league generates NOK 400 million per year in domestic television rights.

This was the nation's fifth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics in the post-Soviet era. The National Olympic Committee of Ukraine sent a total of 238 athletes, split equally between men and women, to compete in 21 sports. Ukraine left London with a total of 19 Olympic medals (5 gold, 4 silver, and 10 bronze), their lowest in Summer Olympic history since their debut in 1996. Five of these medals were awarded to the team in boxing; three each in athletics and sprint canoeing, and two each in fencing, shooting, and weightlifting. Two Ukrainian athletes won more than a single Olympic medal, while all of their competitors in sprint canoeing won at least a medal. For the first time in its history, Ukraine did not win an Olympic medal in archery. Among the nation's medalists were épée fencer Yana Shemyakina and the women's quadruple sculls team, led by Yana Dementyeva, who both won Ukraine's first Olympic gold medals in their respective events. Sprint canoer Inna Osypenko, who won two silver in London, became one of the most successful Ukrainian athletes in history, with a total of four Olympic medals. Meanwhile, Yuriy Cheban won the coveted gold medal in the men's sprint canoe singles, in addition to his bronze from Beijing.

Films dealing with the subject of the Holocaust include both documentary and narrative films. These films were produced from the early 1940s before the extent of the Holocaust was widely known and have continued to be made since then. The films span multiple genres, with documentary films including footage filmed both by the Germans for their propaganda purposes and by the Allies, compilations, survivor testimonies and docudramas, and narrative films including war films, action films, love stories, psychological dramas, and even comedies. passages: ", "label": "Heinz Schirk"}

Building societies offer banking and related financial services, especially savings and mortgage lending. Building societies exist in the United Kingdom and Australia, and used to exist in Ireland and several Commonwealth countries. They are similar to credit unions in organisation, though few enforce a common bond. However, rather than promoting thrift and offering unsecured and business loans, the purpose of a building society is to provide home mortgages to members. Borrowers and depositors are society members, setting policy and appointing directors on a one-member, one-vote basis. Building societies often provide other retail banking services, such as current accounts, credit cards and personal loans. The term building society first arose in the 19th century in Great Britain from cooperative savings groups. In the United Kingdom, building societies actively compete with banks for most consumer banking services, especially mortgage lending and savings accounts, and regulations permit up to half of their lending to be funded by debt to non-members, allowing societies to access wholesale bond and money markets to fund mortgages. The world's largest building society is Britain's Nationwide Building Society. Further, in Australia, building societies also compete with retail banks and offer the full range of banking services to consumers. passages: Norwich Building Society: Norwich & Peterborough Building Society ( or N & P ) is a trading name of Yorkshire Building Society based in Bradford , West Yorkshire . | Peterborough Building Society: Norwich & Peterborough Building Society ( or N & P ) is a trading name of Yorkshire Building Society based in Bradford , West Yorkshire . | Norwich & Peterborough Building Society: Norwich & Peterborough Building Society ( or N & P ) is a trading name of Yorkshire Building Society based in Bradford , West Yorkshire . | Haywards Heath Building Society: It changed its name to Haywards Heath Building Society in 1989 and merged with the Yorkshire Building Society in 1992 .

Aside from the main metropolitan mint in the capital, Constantinople, a varying number of provincial mints were also established in other urban centres, especially during the 6th century. Most provincial mints except for Syracuse were closed or lost to invasions by the mid-7th century. After the loss of Syracuse in 878, Constantinople became the sole mint for gold and silver coinage until the late 11th century, when major provincial mints began to re-appear.

[ 19 ] The default list order is arranged by the position numbers used by official baseball scorekeepers ( i.e. , 1 – pitcher , 2 – catcher , etc . ) . | An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each position - who in turn are given the honorific All-America and typically referred to as All-American athletes, or simply All-Americans. Although the honorees generally do not compete as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. In 1950, the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) selected its first All-American baseball team. It has since chosen All-American teams and a player of the year for each division (National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I, Division II, Division III, National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, junior college and high school). In 1991, Collegiate Baseball began selecting college All-American, Freshman All-American, and High School All-American teams. Baseball America has selected - since 1981 - pre-season and post-season All-American teams and College Player of the Year honorees. Various organizations selected All-American lists of the best players for the 1991 NCAA Division I college baseball season. The ABCA, the magazine Baseball America, and Collegiate Baseball were the NCAA-sanctioned selectors. This list only includes players selected to the post-season All-American first team for each selector. However, many All-American selections choose second, third, etc. teams from the remaining eligible candidates. passages: Wichita State Shockers baseball: The Shockers have made the College World Series seven times , winning the national championship in 1989 . | Pedro Grifol: Grifol attended Christopher Columbus High School in Miami , Florida , where he was the Florida high school baseball player of the year in 1988 .

They are listed below . | There are 274 listed buildings in the Borough of Barrow-in-Furness, with about 70% in Barrow-in-Furness itself. The 2015 Heritage Index formed by the Royal Society of Arts and the Heritage Lottery Fund placed the Borough as seventh highest of 325 English districts with an especially high score relating to industrial heritage assets. The Barrow Island conservation area contains dozens of historic shipyard buildings and tenements, while numerous listed buildings can be found lining Abbey Road and Duke Street, which were designed as the principal north to south and east to west thoroughfares of the Victorian planned town. Despite many buildings and structures dating from this era, an abundance of listed buildings exist throughout the Borough that pre-date Barrow, in villages that were consumed by the rapidly expanding town. One notable example being Newbarns village which retains its original 18th century street layout. Significant clusters of listed buildings can be found around the ruins of the 12th-century Furness Abbey and Market Street, the Medieval centre of Dalton-in-Furness. The oldest listed building in Barrow is Furness Abbey, dated 1127 and the newest is the John Whinnerah Institute, completed in 1934. Within other heritage categories the only asset recognised by Historic England in the Borough is Barrow Park which is designated as Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. passages: ", "label": "Dalton South"}

The team was a member of the Canadian Soccer League, and played its final home games at Lamport Stadium in the city of Toronto, Ontario. The club found success early on since its inception as the Toronto Supra in the Canadian National Soccer League, making the postseason in 1996, and the championship finals in 1997. With the creation of the Canadian Professional Soccer League in 1998, Toronto missed out in registering for the league which resulted in the club completing in local amateur leagues. Supra would eventually return to the professional level in 2001, entering the CPSL as an expansion franchise. Immediately Supra become a playoff and title contender reaching the CPSL Championship finals in its debut season in the CPSL. Supra would claim their first piece of silverware in 2004 by clinching their division title. However, soon after, Supra faced a decline in their performance, and re-branded itself as Portugal FC and managed to continue fighting for playoff berths. In 2011, Portugal FC merged with its youth club the Toronto Eagles and became SC Toronto. Massive changes occurred within the managerial and team structure, which brought about a positive effect on the team's performance, and re-established Toronto as powerhouse within the league. Due to the merger Toronto finished first in the overall standings and achieved their second regular season championship, and continued dominating the league until its departure from the CSL in 2013. passages: Jorge Armua: Jorge Armua is a former Uruguayan footballer and head coach of several Ontario soccer clubs . | ", "label": "Clarkson"}

A further fourth spot may also be granted to the fourth placed team in the final league ranking, given that the Bulgarian Cup holder has finished among the top three teams at the end of the season. A total of 67 clubs have competed in the Bulgarian top-tier since its establishment. In the last decade, many teams such as the current champions Ludogorets were introduced for the first time in the league.

ALPG stands for Australian Ladies Professional Golf. The ALPG was founded as the Ladies Professional Golf Association of Australia (LPGAA) in 1972 by Alan Gillott, who also later on founded The Golfer newspaper, a free publication provided to golfers and golf clubs, Australia-wide. The LPGAA switched to its current name (ALPG) in 1991. The first events featured twelve competitors, and the early years were a struggle. However the long term trend was of gradual expansion and by 2004 there were over 150 members. The season features about a dozen tournaments, usually played over the Australian summer between November and March. The ANZ Ladies Masters and MFS Women's Australian Open have long been the leading events on the tour, with both being co-sanctioned with the more prestigious Ladies European Tour (LET) which helps attract a higher quality field. In 2010 the New Zealand Women's Open became the third tournament to be co-sanctioned by the LET. The ANZ Masters, the Australian Open and the New Zealand Open have prize funds of A$600,000, A$500,000 and A$400,000 respectively, each higher than the prize funds of all 10 remaining events combined. The New South Wales Open and the Royal Canberra Ladies Classic have purses of A$100,000 and A$125,000 respectively, and no other event has a purse of over A$25,000. Since 2012, the Women's Australian Open has also been co-sanctioned by the U.S. LPGA Tour; in its first year as an LPGA Tour event, the prize fund increased to US$1.1 million. passages: Haru Nomura: Harukyo Nomura ( Japanese : 野村敏京 ; Korean : 문민경 ; born 25 November 1992 ) is a Japanese female professional golfer .

It takes precedence over all other postnominals and medals. It can be awarded to a person of any rank in any service and civilians under military command, and is presented to the recipient by the British monarch during an investiture held at Buckingham Palace. It is the joint highest award for bravery in the United Kingdom with the George Cross, which is the equivalent honour for valour not in the face of the enemy. The VC has been awarded on 1356 occasions to 1353 individual recipients. The ribbon is crimson, 38 mm (1.5 inches) wide. The original (1856) specification for the award stated that the ribbon should be red for army recipients and blue for naval ones. However the dark blue ribbon was abolished soon after the formation of the Royal Air Force on 1 April 1918. On 22 May 1920 King George V signed a warrant that stated all recipients would now receive a red ribbon and the living recipients of the naval version were required to exchange their ribbons for the new colour. There have been a total of 26 recipients of the VC who were serving in the Royal Air Force, including the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, at the time of their valiant deed or deeds. First World War VCs awarded to airmen in the Royal Flying Corps (13[citation needed] in total) and the Royal Naval Air Service (2 in total) are not listed below, see the RN page for the RNAS recipients. The vast majority of air force VCs awarded in a single conflict were for the Second World War, with the majority being won by Bomber Command aircrew and only one going to Fighter Command. passages: ", "label": "Ferdinand West"}

Their diversity stems from the different positions of the phenolic -OH groups. They are distinct from flavanols (with a) such as catechin, another class of flavonoids. Flavonols are present in a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. In Western populations, estimated daily intake is in the range of 20-50 mg per day for flavonols. Individual intake varies depending on the type of diet consumed. The phenomenon of dual fluorescence (due to excited state intramolecular proton transfer or ESIPT) is induced by tautomerism of flavonols (and glucosides) and could contribute to plant UV protection and flower colour. Besides being a subclass of Flavonoids, flavonols are suggested by a study of cranberry juice to play a role along with proanthocyanidins, in the juice's ability to block bacterial adhesion, demonstrated by the compressing the fimbria of E. coli bacteria in the urinary tract so as to greatly reduce the ability of those bacteria to stay put and initiate an infection. Flavonol aglycones in plants are potent antioxidants that serve to protect the plant from reactive oxygen species (ROS). passages: ", "label": "Astragalin"}

Such elections are called by state governors to fill vacancies that occur when a member of the House of Representatives dies or resigns before the biennial general election. Winners of these elections serve the remainder of the term and are usually candidates in the next general election for their districts. In the United States, these contests are called special elections. They are sometimes held on the regular Election Day like regular congressional elections but often they are on different days as determined by local statutes. Despite their name, however, special elections to the U.S. House happen often. Furthermore, one published study shows that special elections are explained by the same factors as regular congressional elections. Special elections to the U.S. House of Representatives have occurred at least once in all states except Iowa and Idaho. A few special elections for territorial delegates to Congress have also been held. A 2016 study of special elections to the United States House of Representatives found that while candidate characteristics affect special election outcomes, presidential approval is predictive of special election outcomes as well. Furthermore, we find that the effect of presidential approval on special election outcomes has increased in magnitude from 1995 to 2014, with the 2002 midterm representing an important juncture in the nationalization of special elections. passages: ", "label": "Connecticut at-large"}

The Academy was founded in 1845 and graduated its first class in 1846. The Academy is often referred to as Annapolis, while sports media refer to the Academy as Navy and the students as Midshipmen; this usage is officially endorsed. During the latter half of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th, the United States Naval Academy was the primary source of U.S. Navy and Marine Corps officers, with the Class of 1881 being the first to provide officers to the Marine Corps. Graduates of the Academy are also given the option of entering the United States Army or United States Air Force. Most Midshipmen are admitted through the congressional appointment system. The curriculum emphasizes various fields of engineering. The list is drawn from graduates, non-graduate former Midshipmen, current Midshipmen, and faculty of the Naval Academy. Over 50 U.S. astronauts have graduated from the Naval Academy, more than from any other undergraduate institution.

Recently, some new markers have been added at junctions with some state highways. However, others were never added, so it may not be easy to find these routes. Also, several of these routes begin on the outskirts of small towns and villages, and there are no signs pointing the way for motorists to find these routes from main streets. TO signs with arrows would be extremely helpful to motorists, especially in Downsville, Walton, Sidney, and Andes, where the location of the routes can not easily be ascertained. Several county routes are unusual as they terminate as local roads in remote areas. County Rt. 22 begins on a side street in Walton, and ends as a remote town road in the middle of nowhere. County Route 6 has 2 beginnings on State Route 28, but no connecting center section. County Rt. 36 just climbs a long hill and ends. Many County Maintained Routes in Delaware County have no winter road maintenance (plowing, salting, sanding) at NIGHT due to safety concerns (Mountainous Roads). passages: Franklin (town), New York: Franklin is a town in Delaware County , New York , United States .

There is no official tracking of domestic box office figures within India, and Indian sites publishing data are frequently pressured to increase their domestic box office estimates. Indian films have been screened in markets around the world since the early 20th century. As of 2003, there are markets in over 90 countries where films from India are screened. During the first decade of the 21st century, there was a steady rise in the ticket price, a tripling in the number of theaters and an increase in the number of prints of a film being released, which led to a large increase in the box office collections.

In the early years, Australia's athletes did poorly; only two athletes placed in the top half of their events before 1976, while the vast majority placed in the bottom quarter, including some who finished last. This lack of success was attributed to the Australian culture, climate and lack of snow, as well as the lack of support for the athletes - sports administrators regarded investment in winter sports as futile. After the appointment of Geoff Henke - who had been unable to compete in 1956 after the administrators neglected to endorse his ice hockey team's application - as team manager in 1976, the results slowly began to improve, and by the 1990s, some Australians were regarded as medal prospects. The upturn in performance was accompanied by increased government funding for winter sports, the creation of the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia and the purchase of an alpine training base in Austria. Australia won its first medal, a bronze, in 1994 in the men's 5,000 metres short track relay speed skating event. Zali Steggall gained Australia's first individual medal in 1998, when she won bronze in the slalom event. In 2002, Steven Bradbury won the 1,000 metres short track speed skating and Alisa Camplin won the aerials event, making Australia the only southern hemisphere country to have won a gold medal at a Winter Olympics. Australia sent 40 competitors to compete in 10 sports at the 2006 Games in Turin. Their goal of winning a medal was achieved when Dale Begg-Smith won the gold in men's freestyle moguls skiing. Camplin claimed her second medal, a bronze in the aerials event.

The division consists of five teams: the Denver Nuggets, the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Portland Trail Blazers and the Utah Jazz. The division was created at the start of the 2004-05 season, when the league expanded from 29 to 30 teams with the addition of the Charlotte Bobcats. The league realigned itself into three divisions in each conference. The Northwest Division began with five inaugural members: the Nuggets, the Timberwolves, the Trail Blazers, the Seattle SuperSonics and the Jazz. The Trail Blazers and SuperSonics joined from the Pacific Division, while the Nuggets, the Timberwolves and Jazz joined from the now-defunct Midwest Division. The most recent division champion is the Denver Nuggets, having won its fourth division championship in the 2018-19 NBA season. The SuperSonics-Thunder franchise has won the most Northwest Division titles, with six, while the Nuggets have won four, the Jazz have won three, the Trail Blazers have won two, and the Timberwolves have never won the Northwest Division title.

This includes weasels, ferrets, minks, otters, martens, and skunks. Fictional badgers are instead found within the list of fictional badgers.

Orlando M. Poe . The light sits atop a brick tower with a stone base . Prior to 1900 , the brick was left in its natural color and state , as it was unusually hard and held up well to the elements . In 1900 the light was painted white for the first time , to assuage the complaints of mariners who said the brick was difficult to see . It remained that color until 1975 , when it was sand blasted , and returned to its natural color . The lantern is capped by a copper roof\n5  6    Charles Mears Silver Lake Boardinghouse      July 31 , 1986 ( # 86002115 )                             Corner of Lighthouse and Silver Lake Channel Rds . 43°39′20″N 86°32′15″W / 43.655556°N 86.5375°W / 43.655556 ; -86.5375 ( Charles Mears Silver Lake Boardinghouse )            Mears                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Charles Mears was a Chicago lumberman who controlled timberland and owned mills across Michigan .

They have small heads, upturned snouts, erect limbs, and a body covered by plate-like scutes. All aetosaurs belong to the family Stagonolepididae. Two distinct subdivisions of aetosaurs are currently recognized, Desmatosuchinae and Aetosaurinae, based primarily on differences in the morphology of the bony scutes of the two groups. Over 20 genera of aetosaurs have been described, and recently there has been controversy regarding the description of some of these genera. Aetosaur fossil remains are known from Europe, North and South America, parts of Africa and India. Since their armoured plates are often preserved and are abundant in certain localities, aetosaurs serve as important Late Triassic tetrapod index fossils. Many aetosaurs had wide geographic ranges, but their stratigraphic ranges were relatively short. Therefore, the presence of particular aetosaurs can accurately date a site that they are found in. Aetosaur remains have been found since the early 19th century, although the very first remains that were described were mistaken for fish scales. Aetosaurs were later recognized as crocodile relatives, with early paleontologists considering them to be semiaquatic scavengers.

Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, English and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto Més que un club (More than a club). The official Barça anthem is the Cant del Barça, written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs. Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the world's second richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €495 million in 2011-12 season. Barcelona played its first friendly match on 8 December 1899 against the English colony in Barcelona in the old velodrome in Bonanova. Initially, Barcelona played against other local clubs in various Catalan tournaments. In 1929, the club became one of the founding members of La Liga, Spain's first truly national league, and has since achieved the distinction of being one of only three clubs to have never been relegated, along with Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. Barcelona is the only European club to have played continental football every season since 1955.

In the same year, the Baltimore-based Turf and Sports Digest magazine instituted a similar award. Starting in 1950, the Thoroughbred Racing Associations (TRA) began naming its own champion. The following list provides the name of the horses chosen by these organizations. Whenever there were different champions named, the horses are listed side-by-side with the one chosen as champion by the Daily Racing Form noted with the letters (DRF), the one chosen by the Thoroughbred Racing Associations by the letters (TRA) and the one chosen by Turf and Sports Digest by the letters (TSD). The Daily Racing Form, the Thoroughbred Racing Associations, and the National Turf Writers Association all joined forces in 1971 to create the Eclipse Award. Champions from 1887 through 1935 were selected retrospectively by a panel of experts as published by The Blood-Horse magazine. passages: Cain Hoy Stable: It was owned by Harry Guggenheim who also raced horses in Europe .

It was first referred to in 1173 when Geoffrey de Constentyn held it against Henry II during the barons ' rebellion . Stockport Castle was originally constructed with timber and earthwork defences , though these were replaced with stone walls at the start of the 13th century . The castle lay in ruins by 1535 and was demolished in 1775 to be replaced by a cotton mill . Although no trace of the keep on top of the motte survives , it was recorded in 1775 as being irregular in shape and measuring 31 by 60 metres ( 102 by 197 ft ) .

The castle constructed from timber , with the conical motte measuring 40 metres ( 130 ft ) in diameter at the base and 17 metres ( 56 ft ) at the top ; the bailey covers approximately 2,400 square metres ( 0.59 acres ) . It is unclear when the castle was built , but it was most likely constructed during the late 12th century and belonged to Hamon de Massey . A suggested late 12th century date for the construction of the castle would mean it was probably constructed to aid in the barons ' rebellion against Henry II . The castle had fallen out of use by the 13th century\nterms_explanation:\n\ntable_summary:\n\ntable_context:\nList of castles in Greater Manchester | List of castles |  | There are nine castles in Greater Manchester, a metropolitan county in North West England. They consist of four motte-and-baileys, three fortified manor houses, an enclosure castle, and a possible shell keep. A motte-and-bailey castle has two elements, the motte is an artificial conical mound with a wooden stockade and stronghold on top, usually a stone keep or tower. A bailey is a defended enclosure below the motte, surrounded by a ditch. Motte-and-bailey castles were the most common type of castle in England following the Norman Conquest. A shell keep was a motte with a stone wall rather than a wooden stockade on top; there would have been no tower within the walls. Four of Greater Manchester's castles are scheduled monuments: Buckton, Bury, Radcliffe Tower, and Watch Hill. A scheduled monument is a nationally important archaeological site or historic building, given protection against unauthorised change. The purpose of a castle was not simply militaristic, but was also considered to be a stamp of authority over the population of an area and a status symbol. Some would have acted as centres of trade and administration for a manor. The earliest castles in Greater Manchester are Dunham and Watch Hill in Trafford, Ullerwood in Manchester, and Stockport Castle in Stockport.

Much of this military history of Canada is commemorated today with memorials across the country and around the world. Canadian memorials commemorate the sacrifices made as early as the Seven Years' War to the modern day War on Terror. As Newfoundland was a British Dominion until joining Confederation in 1949, there are several monuments in Newfoundland and Labrador and abroad which were dedicated to Newfoundland servicemen and women. There are currently 6,293 war memorials in Canada registered with the National Inventory of Military Memorials, which is under the Canadian Department of Veterans Affairs.

The word decathlon was formed, in analogy to the word pentathlon, from Greek δέκα (déka, meaning ten) and ἄθλος (áthlos, or ἄθλον, áthlon, meaning contest or prize). Events are held over two consecutive days and the winners are determined by the combined performance in all. Performance is judged on a points system in each event, not by the position achieved. The decathlon is contested mainly by male athletes, while female athletes typically compete in the heptathlon. Traditionally, the title of World's Greatest Athlete has been given to the person who wins the decathlon, thus the world's greatest athlete of all times is the record-man of decathlon (Kevin Mayer as of September 2018). This began when King Gustav V of Sweden told Jim Thorpe, You, sir, are the world's greatest athlete after Thorpe won the decathlon at the Stockholm Olympics in 1912. The event is similar to the pentathlon held at the ancient Greek Olympics, and also similar to a competition called an all-around, which was contested at the United States amateur championships in 1884. Another all-around was held at the 1904 Summer Olympics. The modern decathlon first appeared at the 1912 Games. The current official decathlon world record holder is French Kevin Mayer, who scored a total of 9,126 points at the 2018 Décastar in France. passages: ", "label": "Philip Mulkey"}

The five nominated films (highlighted in bold) came from Czechoslovakia, Hong Kong, Iceland, Sweden and the eventual winner, Mediterraneo, from Italy. Hong Kong and Iceland received their first-ever nominations, while Czechoslovakia received its final nomination as a unified state. Germany caused controversy when it took the unusual step not to submit any film to the competition. Europa, Europa by Agnieszka Holland was one of the pre-selection favorites to win the award. Although the film was made in German and about Germany, the country's National Film Board said that because they considered the film to be a majority-French production, and because the director was Polish, they did not consider it qualified to represent Germany. This is the only time since 1977 that Germany failed to be represented. Other countries notable by their absence included Brazil, Egypt, Finland, Greece and Romania. In spite of a rule requiring films to be in the language of the submitting country, AMPAS decided to accept a submission from the United Kingdom that was mostly in Russian, marking the UK's first-ever participation in the competition. AMPAS acknowledged that they had received four submissions from new Eastern European republics, Armenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia, which had each declared independence in mid-to-late 1991. Since none of the countries had yet been recognized internationally, the films were disqualified and not screened, although representatives from their parent states- the USSR and Yugoslavia- were allowed to compete. AMPAS did not announce the titles, but based on the small size of these republic's film industries at the time it appears certain that Macedonia chose Stole Popov's Tetoviranje, the most celebrated Yugoslavian film of 1991, and that Croatia, Slovenia and Armenia likely chose family drama Fragments, black comedy The Cartier Operation and surreal religious drama The Voice in the Wilderness respectively. passages: ", "label": "Cuba"}

They were established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which dictates that the awards should be administered by the Nobel Foundation. Another prize, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, was established in 1968 by the Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, for contributors to the field of economics. Each prize is awarded by a separate committee: the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, and Economics, the Karolinska Institute awards the Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee awards the Prize in Peace. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a cash prize that has varied throughout the years. In 1901, the winners of the first Nobel Prizes were given 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2007. In 2008, the winners were awarded a prize amount of 10,000,000 SEK. The awards are presented in Stockholm in an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. As of 2009, there have been 15 Nobel laureates affiliated with Imperial College London. Imperial College considers laureates who attended the university as undergraduate students, graduate students or were members of the faculty as affiliated laureates. Frederick Gowland Hopkins, who attended the Royal School of Mines from 1881 to 1883, was the first Imperial College-affiliated laureate, winning the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1929. One Nobel Prize was shared by two Imperial College laureates; Ernst Boris Chain and Alexander Fleming won the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. passages: Alexander Fleming: His best-known discoveries are the enzyme lysozyme in 1923 and the world 's first antibiotic substance benzylpenicillin ( Penicillin G ) from the mould Penicillium notatum in 1928 , for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945 with Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain .

The system is operated by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) and serves five counties in Pennsylvania - Bucks, Delaware, Montgomery, Chester, and Philadelphia - as well as Mercer County in New Jersey and New Castle County in Delaware. The system covers a total route length of 223 miles (359 km), 98 miles (158 km) of which are owned by SEPTA, with the remainder owned by Amtrak, CSX Transportation, and the City of Philadelphia. In the 2019 fiscal year, SEPTA Regional Rail had an annual ridership of 34.2 million, with an average weekday ridership of 118,800. There are 13 lines within the Regional Rail system, with 155 active stations. Six fare zones in the system determine the ticket price, based on the distance traveled. Fare zones are designated as Zones 1 through 4, based on the station's distance from Center City Philadelphia, with additional zones for stations in the Center City area (CCP zone) and stations in New Jersey (NJ zone). Despite its close proximity to Center City, the four Airport Terminal stations are located within Zone 4. The Regional Rail system was built in the early 20th century and originally consisted of two separate systems, operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Reading Company, respectively. SEPTA was formed in 1963, and the Pennsylvania Railroad merged into the Penn Central Transportation Company in 1968. Penn Central and the Reading Company operated the railroads until they were taken over by Conrail in 1976, which operated the system through 1982. SEPTA commenced operation of the Regional Rail Division on January 1, 1983, which gave SEPTA complete operational control of its railroads. passages: ", "label": "R7 Trenton"}

The main route utilizes CR 101 through CR 105 , with the remaining routes serving as spurs or connectors off the primary path . Route list | County routes in Sullivan County, New York, are maintained by the Sullivan County highway department and signed with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices-standard yellow-on-blue pentagon route marker. The county highway system comprises roughly 140 routes arranged across the county in groups of nine. For the most part, state routes in Sullivan County are county-maintained and co-signed with county routes. However, the converse is not true; that is, not all county routes overlap state routes for their entire length. Typically, each series consists of county routes along a single roadway, often overlapping with state highways in the process. The lowest numbered route in the system is County Route 11 (CR 11); the highest is CR 183C. Note that routes 160 through 169 do not conform to any style, and coincidentally the 170 through 179 series (with the exception of the spur designated 174A) follows the pre-expressway routing of New York State Route 17 (NY 17).

It was the fourteenth race of the 1999 FIA Formula One World Championship. The 66-lap race was won by Johnny Herbert, driving a Stewart-Ford, with Jarno Trulli second in a Prost-Peugeot and Herbert's teammate Rubens Barrichello third. It was considered to be one of the most eventful and exciting races of the 1999 season. Going into the race Mika Häkkinen, Eddie Irvine, Heinz-Harald Frentzen and David Coulthard were all harbouring World Championship aspirations. Häkkinen and Irvine were tied for the points lead, with Frentzen 10 points behind them and Coulthard a further two points back. In the previous round at Monza, Häkkinen had made an unforced error while leading, Coulthard and Irvine finished only 5th and 6th and Frentzen took his second race win of the season. In the race, a high number of retirements saw Marc Gené take 6th place for the Minardi team, their first points since Pedro Lamy's at the 1995 Australian Grand Prix. The Stewart cars took first and third, with Prost's Jarno Trulli finishing second. As a consequence of the race, Häkkinen moved into the lead in the World Drivers' Championship, two points ahead of Irvine, with Frentzen a further twelve behind. In the World Constructors Championship, McLaren extended their lead to twelve points over Ferrari. It would prove to be Johnny Herbert's 3rd and final F1 victory, also his 7th and final podium in what was the only victory for the Stewart Grand Prix team as well as their only double podium. passages: ", "label": "Luca Badoer"}

Named after the painter J. M. W. Turner, it was first presented in 1984, and is one of the United Kingdom's most prestigious, but controversial, art awards. Initially, the prize was awarded to the individual who had made the greatest contribution to art in Britain in the previous twelve months, but it now celebrates a British artist under fifty for an outstanding exhibition or other presentation of their work in the twelve months preceding. The winner is chosen by a panel of four independent judges invited by the Tate and chaired by the director of Tate Britain. The prize is accompanied by a monetary award of £25,000, although the amount has varied depending on the sponsor. For example, between 2004 and 2007, while sponsored by Gordon's, the total prize fund was £40,000; £25,000 was awarded to the winner and £5,000 to the losing nominees. A shortlist of finalists is drawn up and usually published about six months before the prize is awarded in November or December each year, although shortlists were not made public in 1988 and 1990; in 1989, a list of seven commended artists was published. Controversy surrounded the presentation of the inaugural prize to Malcolm Morley as some critics questioned his relevance to art in Britain; he had lived and worked in the United States for the previous 20 years. Since its inception, the prize itself has received considerable criticism. In 2002, after Culture Minister Kim Howells described the Turner Prize as conceptual bullshit, Prince Charles wrote a letter of support to him, stating It has contaminated the art establishment for so long. Since 2000, the Stuckists art group have protested against the prize; in 2008, they gave out leaflets with the message The Turner Prize is Crap, to protest at the lack of figurative paintings amongst the nominees' exhibitions. Considerable media pressure is applied to nominees and winners of the Turner Prize. passages: Anish Kapoor: In 2017 Kapoor designed the statuette for the 2018 Brit Awards .

The competition was founded in 2007 as the successor to the National Football League (NFL) and competition commenced in November 2007. The league was launched as India's first ever professional football league and with the aim to increase the player pool for India's national team. Unlike the franchise based Indian Super League, the I-League operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the I-League 2nd Division. For the clubs that become I-League champions, they are granted the opportunity to participate in the AFC Cup, Asia's secondary international club competition. Since the inception of the I-League, a total of seven clubs have been crowned champions. Dempo have won the most titles in league history, being crowned champions three times. Churchill Brothers and former I-League side Bengaluru have won the league twice. Salgaocar, Mohun Bagan, Aizawl, Minerva Punjab, and the current champions, Chennai City have won it once. passages: Dempo S.C.: Dempo Sports Club is a football club based in Panjim , Goa . | ", "label": "Panjim , Goa"}

Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position. The award for Best Contemporary R&B Album, which recognizes R&B albums with more contemporary musical stylings, was first presented to Ashanti at the 45th Grammy Awards in 2003 for her self-titled debut album. Prior to the creation of this category, contemporary R&B albums were eligible for the more general category Best R&B Album. According to the category description guide for the 52nd Grammy Awards, the award is reserved for albums containing at least 51% playing time of newly recorded contemporary R&B vocal tracks which may also incorporate production elements found in rap music. Award recipients included the producers, engineers, and/or mixers associated with the nominated work in addition to the recording artists. Beyoncé holds the record for the most wins, with three (all of her first three solo albums have earned her the award). Usher is the only other artist to receive the award more than once. The award has been presented to artists from the United States each year to date. Beyoncé and Ne-Yo share the record for the most nominations, with three each. In addition, Beyoncé earned a nomination as a member of the group Destiny's Child for the album Destiny Fulfilled. Brandy, Chris Brown, Janet Jackson and R.

The ranking was originally published from 2007-2011 by the Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan (HEEACT) and has been published since 2012 by the National Taiwan University. It uses bibliometric methods to analyze and rank the scientific paper performance. In addition to the overall ranking, it includes a list of the top universities in six fields and fourteen subjects. The rankings were introduced in 2007. The original ranking methodology favored toward universities with medical schools. In 2008, HEEACT began publishing a Field Based Ranking including six fields: agriculture and environmental sciences (AGE), clinical medicine (MED), engineering, computing, and technology (ENG), life sciences (LIFE), natural sciences (SCI), and social sciences (SOC). In 2010, HEEACT began publishing subject rankings in fields of various field of science and technology. Science fields are divided into physics, chemistry, mathematics, and geosciences. Technology fields are split up into electrical engineering, computer science, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering (including energy and fuels), materials science, and civil engineering (including environmental engineering). HEEACT ended the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities Project in 2012. Due to disagreement about ranking results, the Taiwanese education authorities announced that the government would no longer support the Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan to do this ranking. passages: Harvard University: James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II ; he began to liberalize admissions after the war .

Among the incidents were a string of employee suicides at Taiwan-owned electronics manufacturer Foxconn and strike actions at Honda factories in Guangdong province, both of which resulted in wage increases. The Economist stated that wages were merely rising to make up for lost ground due to wage freezes, and China's inflationary monetary environment at the time made regular pay rises a necessity for workers concerned with maintaining a high quality of life. [citation needed] Reuters quoted Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda, as saying, this has both good and bad elements. A wage increase is not necessarily bad if properly managed. The experience of the past 100 years shows that auto workers become auto consumers also. The events at Honda and Foxconn were followed by a string of labour-related protests and strikes at foreign-owned factories, mostly in the south of the country. passages: Tianjin: It is one of the nine national central cities in Mainland China , with a total population estimated at 15,621,200 in 2016 .

The 16th largest private university in the nation, Drexel is made up of nine colleges and four schools, most of which serve both undergraduate and graduate students. It offers 96 undergraduate degree programs, 88 master's programs, and 35 doctoral programs. Drexel was founded as a technical school in 1891 for the improvement of industrial education as a means of opening better and wider avenues of employment to young men and women. Drexel began awarding undergraduate degrees in 1914, starting with the Bachelor of Science in engineering; before that, Drexel granted certificates or diplomas in the field of enrollment. In 1931, Drexel began offering graduate degrees through the School of Home Economics. Since its founding the university has graduated over 100,000 alumni. Certificate-earning alumni such as artist Violet Oakley and illustrator Frank Schoonover reflect the early emphasis on art as part of the university's curriculum. With World War II, the university's technical programs swelled, and as a result Drexel graduated alumni such as Paul Baran, one of the founding fathers of the Internet and one of the inventors of the packet switching network, and Norman Joseph Woodland the inventor of barcode technology. In addition to its emphasis on technology Drexel has graduated several notable athletes such as National Basketball Association (NBA) basketball players Michael Anderson and Malik Rose, and several notable business people such as Raj Gupta, former President and Chief executive officer (CEO) of Rohm and Haas, and Kenneth C. Dahlberg, former CEO of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). passages: ", "label": "Open source"}

The team competes at the NCAA Division I level and is a member of the Pac-12 Conference. The team participates in indoor and outdoor track and field as well as cross country. Known as the Ducks, Oregon's first track and field team was fielded in 1895. The team holds its home meets at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon. Robert Johnson is the current head coach and since the program's inception in 1895, there have only been seven permanent head coaches. The Ducks claim 31 NCAA National Championships among the three disciplines. Due to its rich heritage, the home of the Ducks is popularly dubbed as Tracktown, USA. Four of the head coaches in Oregon's history have been inducted into the USTFCCCA Hall of Fame. Several people involved with the program have developed innovative coaching strategies and helped restructure amateur athletics. Alumni of the program have continued to the Olympics and professional ranks while some others have founded athletic corporations like Nike and SPARQ. Oregon's track and field history has been documented in two major motion films Without Limits and Prefontaine as well as the books Bowerman and the Men of Oregon and Pre: The Story of America's Greatest Running Legend. passages: Nike, Inc.: In 2014 the brand alone was valued at $ 19 billion , making it the most valuable brand among sports businesses .

Their study is the field of paleoentomology. Insects inhabited Earth since before the time of the dinosaurs. The earliest identifiable insect is the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti, estimated at 407 to 396 million years ago. Forms similar to many modern insects had already evolved before the dawning of the dinosaur and lived alongside them and beyond up to the present day. Like today, prehistoric insects were an important part of the food chain in their time. The differences between modern and prehistoric varieties can be essential, and, like many other creatures of prehistory, the latter tended to be much larger than their contemporary equivalents. This size difference is thought to be due to higher atmospheric oxygen levels (allowing diffusion through spiracles over greater distances), higher temperatures (enhancing metabolism), and the absence of birds as key predators of insect life. Since insects have chitin exoskeletons rather than mineralized bones, their burial processes differ compared to the fossils of much larger vertebrates such as dinosaurs. Many insect remains are found preserved in the hardened sap of ancient trees (amber). passages: ", "label": "Anonychomyrma geinitzi"}

Its main sponsor is the Finnish national betting agency Veikkaus, hence the league's name. Veikkausliiga was founded in 1990; before that the top division was called Mestaruussarja (championship series) since 1930 which was an amateur or semi-professional league. Between 1908 and 1930 the championship was decided in a cup competition. Ykkönen (division one) has been the second highest level of Finnish football since 1973. During the 1990 and 1991 seasons the Veikkausliiga was played under the name Futisliiga (Swedish: Fotbollsligan). As with certain other cold-climate European countries, league matches in Finland are played in summer, with a schedule usually from April to October. The format and number of teams has changed frequently, and as of 2016 there are 12 teams, with each team playing the others three times, for 33 rounds during the season. The best six teams from the previous season play 17 home matches, while the other six teams play 16 home matches. At the end of the season, the lowest-placed team is relegated to Ykkönen, whose winner is promoted to Veikkausliiga, and the second-worst team plays a two-leg play-off versus the Ykkönen runner-up. In 2010 the average annual salary with fringe benefits for a league player was 24,400 euro. Veikkausliiga is a founding member of the European Professional Football Leagues association. passages: FC Inter Turku: Football Club International Turku , commonly referred to as Inter Turku and colloquially known as Inter , is a professional football club based in Turku , Finland , that competes in the Veikkausliiga , the top flight of Finnish Football .

It includes notable churches either where a church means a congregation (in the New Testament definition) or where a church means a building (in the colloquial sense). It also includes campgrounds and conference centers and retreats that are significant Methodist gathering places, including a number of historic sites of camp meetings. This very limited list includes only historically or architecturally significant buildings, and omits many of the currently very largest and influential congregations which do not meet that standard. Methodism was founded with a large component being a rejection of past churches and was developed by John Wesley and others in large open-air gatherings in Great Britain. In the United States, Methodists (along with Baptists and other Protestants) were major participants in the Second Great Awakening wherein people would travel from a large area to a particular site to camp out, listen to itinerant preachers, and pray. The list also includes selected notable Methodist theological buildings. In the United States, numerous Methodist churches are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and on state and local historic registers, many reflecting the values of plainness, of Gothic architecture, of simple adornment. The Greek Revival style is also simple and came to be adopted for numerous American Methodist churches. passages: ", "label": "Sidney Park Colored Methodist Episcopal Church"}

Consisting of the top players, each team plays a single exhibition game after the conclusion of the high-school basketball season, in an East vs. West format. As part of the annual event, boys and girls compete in a slam dunk contest and a three-point shooting competition, and compete alongside All-American Game alumni in a timed team shootout. The last of these competitions replaced separate overall timed skills competitions for boys and girls. It is rare for girls to compete in the slam dunk contest. However, that contest has been won twice by girls - first in 2004 by Candace Parker, and most recently in 2019 by Fran Belibi. The boys' game has been contested annually since 1978, and the girls game has been played each year since it was added in 2002. The McDonald's All-American designation began in 1977 with the selection of the inaugural team. That year, the All-Americans played in an all-star game against a group of high school stars from the Washington, D.C. area. The following year, the McDonald's game format of East vs. West was begun with a boys contest. In 2002, with the addition of a girls contest, the current girl-game / boy-game doubleheader format began.

Nowadays, teams from the provinces of Ulster and Connacht are eligible to compete, as well as teams from third-level institutions within the three provinces. Contested by 16 teams, it operates on a straight knock-out system. The competition runs from January to February, with most games played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, the others during weekday evenings. Sponsored by Bord na Móna, it is therefore officially known as the Bord na Móna Kehoe Cup. The Kehoe Cup is part of a series of GAA tournaments known as the Bord na Móna Leinster GAA Series, along with the Walsh Cup and the O'Byrne Cup. The original purpose of these competitions was to raise funds to supplement an injury scheme for the players. Nowadays, the funds generated are used to alleviate hardship among players, mentors and families who are in financial difficulty. The funds are administered throughout the twelve counties of Leinster. Apart from this, the competitions provide an opportunity for the county teams to select their panel for the year and prepare for the National Hurling League (NHL). Since the inception of the Kehoe Cup in 1977, a total of 14 teams have won the tournament. Meath and Westmeath are the most successful teams with 8 titles each. passages: ", "label": "0-11 ( 11 )"}

In America , cocoa refers to ground cacao beans . Chocolate is the combination of cocoa , cocoa butter , sugar and other ingredients ( milk , flavorings , and emulsifiers ) and they are sweet . | Candy, known also as sweets and confectionery, has a long history as a familiar food treat that is available in many varieties. Candy varieties are influenced by the size of the sugar crystals, aeration, sugar concentrations, colour and the types of sugar used. Simple sugar or sucrose is turned into candy by dissolving it in water, concentrating this solution through cooking and allowing the mass either to form a mutable solid or to recrystallize. Maple sugar candy has been made in this way for thousands of years, with concentration taking place from both freezing and heating. Other sugars, sugar substitutes, and corn syrup are also used. Jelly candies, such as gumdrops and gummies, use stabilizers including starch, pectin or gelatin. Another type of candy is cotton candy, which is made from spun sugar. In their Thanksgiving Address, Native peoples of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy give special thanks to the Sugar Maple tree as the leader of all trees to recognize its gift of sugar when the People need it most. In traditional times, maple sugar candy reduced from sap was an important food source in the lean times of winter in North America. passages: Hershey's Kisses: Hershey 's Kisses is a brand of chocolate manufactured by The Hershey Company .

The titles are changed to create a play on words; for instance, The Addams Family became The Adnauseum Family. The character names are generally switched in the same fashion. These articles typically cover five pages or more, and are presented as a sequential storyline with caricatures and word balloons. The opening page or two-page splash usually consists of the cast of the show introducing themselves directly to the reader; in some parodies, the writers sometimes attempt to circumvent this convention by presenting the characters without such direct exposition. Many parodies end with the abrupt deus ex machina appearance of outside characters or pop culture figures who are similar in nature to the movie or TV series being parodied, or who comment satirically on the theme. For example, Dr. Phil arrives to counsel the Desperate Housewives, or the cast of Sex and the City show up as the new hookers on Deadwood. The parodies frequently make comedic use of the fourth wall, breaking character, and meta-references. Within an ostensibly self-contained storyline, the characters may refer to the technical aspects of filmmaking, the publicity, hype, or box office surrounding their project, their own past roles, any clichés being used, and so on. Several show business stars have been quoted to the effect that the moment when they knew they'd finally made it was when they saw themselves thus depicted in the pages of Mad. The following list of all the TV show spoofs in Mad Magazine is ordered by the decades in which they were produced. passages: Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (U.S. game show): franchise , running continuously in some form from 1999 until 2019 .

who have been initiated into Tau Kappa Epsilon (TKE) Fraternity. The fraternity was founded by the five men of Joseph Lorenzo Settles, James Carson McNutt, Clarence Arthur Mayer, Owen Ison Truitt, and Charles Roy Atkinson on January 10, 1899, at Illinois Wesleyan University in Bloomington, Illinois. Members traditionally initiate into a chapter during their collegiate career, although honorary members may not necessary have attended a university or college. The list of Tau Kappa Epsilon brothers spans over multiple careers including politics, business, athletics, and entertainment. Among the most recognized include U.S. President Ronald Reagan who was the recipient of the Order of the Golden Eagle, the fraternity's highest honor. Other widely recognized political figures include former West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd, who at the time of his death was the longest-serving member in the history of the United States Congress, and former Arkansas Governor and Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, who while running for president launched a TKE-specific website and visited Tekes on the campaign trail. Dozens of top CEOs and university presidents have also made the list such as Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, and Steve Forbes of Forbes magazine, who was the fraternity's 250,000th initiate. Numerous athletic and music superstars are also Tekes including NFL quarterbacks Terry Bradshaw, Phil Simms, and Aaron Rodgers, Olympians Douglas Blubaugh, Sim Iness, and Johnny Quinn, and singers Elvis Presley, Willie Nelson, and the Everly Brothers. passages: Fred Dryer: John Frederick Dryer ( born July 6 , 1946 ) is an American actor , radio host , screenwriter and former American football defensive end in the National Football League ( NFL ) . | ", "label": "John Frederick Dryer"}

Ashkenazim or Ashkenazi Jews are literally referring to `` German Jews . '' Many Ashkenazi Jews later migrated , largely eastward , forming communities in non German-speaking areas , including Bohemia ( Czech Republic ) , Hungary , Poland , Lithuania , Latvia , Russia , Ukraine , Romania , Belarus , and elsewhere between the 10th and 19th centuries . As many of these countries share similar dishes , and were occupied by the Russian and Austro-Hungarian Empires until the end of World War I , the place where the dish originated is uncertain . | Below is a list of dishes found in Jewish cuisine. passages: Challah: The word is Biblical in origin . | Poland: The Kingdom of Poland was founded in 1025 , and in 1569 it cemented its longstanding political association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the Union of Lublin . | Borscht: Its popularity has spread throughout Eastern Europe and the former Russian Empire , and - by way of migration - to other continents . In North America , borscht is often linked with either Jews or Mennonites , the groups who first brought it there from Europe . | Ukraine: Ukraine is currently in a territorial dispute with Russia over the Crimean Peninsula , which Russia annexed in 2014 . Including Crimea , Ukraine has an area of 603,628 km2 ( 233,062 sq mi ) , making it both the largest country entirely within Europe and the 46th largest country in the world . | Russia: Russia 's capital and largest city is Moscow ; other major urban areas include Saint Petersburg , Novosibirsk , Yekaterinburg , Nizhny Novgorod , Kazan and Chelyabinsk . The East Slavs emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD . | Hungary: With about 10 million inhabitants , Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union . The official language is Hungarian , which is the most widely spoken Uralic language in the world , and among the few non-Indo-European languages to be widely spoken in Europe . | Crêpe: Crêpes are served with a variety of fillings , from the simplest with only sugar to flambéed crêpes Suzette or elaborate savoury galettes . | Brisket (Jewish dish): Brisket is commonly served for Shabbat , Rosh Hashanah , Passover , Hanukkah , and other Jewish holidays in the Ashkenazi Jewish community .

ALPG stands for Australian Ladies Professional Golf. The ALPG was founded as the Ladies Professional Golf Association of Australia (LPGAA) in 1972 by Alan Gillott, who also later on founded The Golfer newspaper, a free publication provided to golfers and golf clubs, Australia-wide. The LPGAA switched to its current name (ALPG) in 1991. The first events featured twelve competitors, and the early years were a struggle. However the long term trend was of gradual expansion and by 2004 there were over 150 members. The season features about a dozen tournaments, usually played over the Australian summer between November and March. The ANZ Ladies Masters and MFS Women's Australian Open have long been the leading events on the tour, with both being co-sanctioned with the more prestigious Ladies European Tour (LET) which helps attract a higher quality field. In 2010 the New Zealand Women's Open became the third tournament to be co-sanctioned by the LET. The ANZ Masters, the Australian Open and the New Zealand Open have prize funds of A$600,000, A$500,000 and A$400,000 respectively, each higher than the prize funds of all 10 remaining events combined. The New South Wales Open and the Royal Canberra Ladies Classic have purses of A$100,000 and A$125,000 respectively, and no other event has a purse of over A$25,000.

This was the nation's fifth appearance at the Summer Olympics after gaining its independence from the former Czechoslovakia. The Czech Olympic Committee sent a total of 133 athletes to the Games, 68 men and 65 women, to compete in 19 sports. Czech Republic left London with a total of 11 medals (4 gold, 3 silver, and 4 bronze), the same total achieved in Atlanta. This was in stark contrast with the zero medal tally of the neighbouring Austria, a nation of roughly comparable size. Finishing the nineteenth position in the medal standings was the second best performance for the Czech Republic in the post-Czechoslovak era. Among the nation's medalists were Barbora Špotáková, who successfully defended her Olympic title in women's javelin throw, and rower Ondřej Synek, who managed to repeat his silver medal in men's single sculls. Three Czech athletes won Olympic gold medals for the first time in history: single sculls rower Miroslava Knapková, modern pentathlete David Svoboda, and mountain biker Jaroslav Kulhavý. Several Czech athletes, however, missed out of medal standings in the finals, including rifle shooter and defending champion Kateřina Emmons, and javelin thrower Vítězslav Veselý. For the first time in its history, the Czech House (located in the Business Design Centre in borough of Islington) had become accessible to the public (i.e. not only the team members and VIPs), attracting over 78,000 visitors during the Olympics. In a brief comparison of selected national centres, AP news agency even awarded this project an imaginary gold medal. passages: David Svoboda: At the 2008 Olympics Svoboda was 28th in the pentathlon . | ", "label": "triathlete"}

The game was released first to PlayStation 2 in 2006, but later released for the Xbox 360 in 2007. Guitar Hero II challenges players to recreate the lead guitar portions of many rock music songs using a specially designed guitar-shaped controller, based on either a Gibson SG for the PlayStation 2 version, a Gibson Explorer for the Xbox 360 version, or else a standard console controller. As notes scroll down the screen towards the player, the player must hit both the fret buttons on the guitar controller and the strum bar at the same time in order to successfully hit the notes. Successfully hitting notes improves the player's performance in the game and also raises their score, while missing notes will reduce the player's performance, and a poor performance may end the song prematurely. Each song can be played at one of four difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard and Expert. These levels reflect the number of fret buttons used and the number and frequency of the notes to be performed.

The league represented the second level of domestic rugby union in Canada, and the highest level wholly indigenous to Canada. In terms of seniority it rested immediately beneath the IRB sponsored North America 4, a former US/Canadian cross-border competition in which two Canadian teams (Canada East and Canada West) took part. Most players took part in RCSL (Super League) on an amateur basis. In early 2009, after 11 seasons of play, Rugby Canada decided to disband the RCSL in the wake of the establishment of the Americas Rugby Championship, the successor to the North America 4. The RCSL was replaced by the Canadian Rugby Championship and the Rugby Canada National Junior Championship, which absorbed the majority of the RCSL teams. passages: Edmonton, Alberta: Edmonton ( /ˈɛdməntən/ ( listen ) ) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Alberta .

See also graphic novels and manga . | Body swaps have been a common storytelling device in fiction media. Novels such as Vice Versa (1882) and Freaky Friday (1972) have inspired numerous film adaptations and retellings, as well as television series and episodes, many with titles derived from Freaky Friday. In 2013, Disney Channel held a Freaky Freakend with seven shows that featured body-swapping episodes. [a] This list features exchanges between two beings, and thus excludes similar phenomena of body hopping, spirit possession, transmigration, and avatars, unless the target being's mind is conversely placed in the source's body. It also excludes age transformations that are sometimes reviewed or promoted as body swaps, as in the movies Big and 17 Again; identity/role swaps, typically between twins, clones, look-alikes, or doppelgängers; and characters with multiple personalities. passages: Adventure Time (season 4): The season was storyboarded and written by Cole Sanchez , Rebecca Sugar , Tom Herpich , Skyler Page , Ako Castuera , Jesse Moynihan , Bert Youn , Somvilay Xayaphone , and Steve Wolfhard while being produced by Cartoon Network Studios and Frederator Studios .

The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. Due to the nature of this medal, it is commonly presented posthumously. Although Medals of Honor can be awarded only to members of the U.S. armed forces, being a U.S. citizen is not a prerequisite for eligibility to receive the medal. Since the American Civil War, hundreds of people born outside the United States have received the medal, the most recent of these recipients being Pedro Cano and Jesus S. Duran who received their medals in March 2014 for actions performed during World War II and the Vietnam War respectively. The large number of foreign-born recipients during the 19th and early 20th centuries was mostly due to immigration waves from Europe. passages: James I. Mestrovitch: James I.

The Medal of Honor is bestowed for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life, above and beyond the call of duty, in actual combat against an armed enemy force. The medal is awarded by the President of the United States on behalf of the Congress. Of the 3,464 Medals of Honor awarded as of September 17, 2009, an estimated 2,021 have been awarded to Irish-American recipients, more than twice the number awarded any other ethnic group; 257 Irish-born Americans have received the Medal of Honor which represents more than half of foreign-born MOH recipients. A monument to these Irish-born Medal of Honor recipients is located at Valley Forge's Medal of Honor Grove; erected by the Ancient Order of Hibernians. The first Irish American to receive the Medal was Michael Madden, who received it for his actions in the American Civil War (Note that the earliest action for which the Medal of Honor was awarded was to Irish American U.S. Army Assistant Surgeon Bernard J.D. Irwin for the engagement at Apache Pass, February 1861. The award was made three decades after the event and after Madden's award). passages: John J. Clausey:  | ", "label": "May 16 , 1875"}

For each airport, the lists cite the city served by the airport as designated by Transport Canada, not necessarily the municipality where the airport is physically located. Since 2010, Toronto-Pearson and Vancouver International have been the two busiest airports by both passengers served and aircraft movements. Toronto-Pearson's location within the most populous metropolitan region of Canada solidifies its top spot amongst all of Canada's airports, serving more passengers and having more aircraft movements than the top two other airports combined. Given its advantageous position on the west coast of Canada, Vancouver International has long served as Canada's hub for flights bound for Asia and Oceania. passages: Kelowna International Airport: The single runway airport operates scheduled air service to Vancouver , Toronto , Calgary , Edmonton , Victoria , and Seattle , as well as less frequent seasonal service to Cancún , Puerto Vallarta , Los Cabos , and Phoenix .

Volume 3 is the first in the series that includes a disclaimer on the box art stating the set is intended for the adult collector and that it may not be suitable for younger audiences. Volume 3 is also the first to contain a warning, this one by Whoopi Goldberg, who is a fan of the Warner cartoon characters, advising the viewers that some of the cartoons on the set contain content that is politically incorrect by today's standards, but will be shown uncut and uncensored for historical reasons, because removing these inexcusable images and jokes from this collection would be the same as saying [these prejudices] never existed. Future volumes also contain this warning, presented instead as a title card before the main menu. passages: A Gruesome Twosome: A Gruesome Twosome is a Warner Bros.

In 1937, the franchise moved to Washington, D.C. The Redskins have played over 1,000 games. In those games, the club won five professional American football championships including two NFL Championships and three Super Bowls. The franchise captured ten NFL divisional titles and six NFL conference championships. Overall, the Redskins have had a total of 23 players and coaches (17 primary, six minor)[b] inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Many Redskins players have also had successful college football careers, including six who were Heisman Trophy winners: Gary Beban, Desmond Howard, Vic Janowicz, George Rogers, Danny Wuerffel, and Robert Griffin III. In addition, the Heisman Trophy sculpture was modeled after Ed Smith in 1934, who became a Redskins player in 1936.

Years during which a city/region did not field a Major League Baseball team are not counted . | Throughout the history of Major League Baseball (MLB), franchises have had various postseason and World Series droughts. All 16 of the original Major League franchises (i.e., those in place when the first World Series was played in 1903) have won the World Series, with the longest wait for a franchise's first championship being for the Phillies (77 years, ending in 1980). Since expansion began in 1961, six of the 14 expansion teams have never won the World Series. Further, one franchise (the Indians) has a current championship drought that pre-dates the expansion era. The three longest championship droughts in history were ended recently by the Red Sox (85 years, ending in 2004), the White Sox (87 years, ending in 2005), and the Cubs (107 years, ending in 2016). Only one expansion franchise (the Mariners) has never won a pennant (i.e., the league championship, the two winners of which meet in the World Series). The three longest pennant droughts in history were recently ended by the Nationals (51 years, starting with the team's foundation and ending in 2019, and including the franchise's entire 36 years as the Montreal Expos), the Rangers (49 years, starting with the team's foundation and ending in 2010) and the Cubs (70 years, ending in 2016). As the Nationals are the third franchise to be based in the city of Washington, their 2019 pennant also ended a drought of 53 seasons played in Washington since their last pennant, which was in 1933 (here we discount the 33 seasons during which there was no team in Washington). Every MLB franchise has at least been to the postseason, especially since expansion of the playoffs in 1994 made that feat easier. The Mariners have the longest active postseason drought at 18 years. Long postseason droughts were ended recently by the Nationals (30 years for the franchise, 45 seasons over 78 years for the city, ending in 2012), the Pirates (20 years, ending in 2013), the Royals (28 years, ending in 2014), and the Blue Jays (21 years, ending in 2015).

Willie Stargell , who was named the World Series Most Valuable Player , hit .400 with a record seven extra-base hits and matched Reggie Jackson 's record of 25 total bases , set in 1977 . | American League: It developed from the Western League , a minor league based in the Great Lakes states , which eventually aspired to major league status . It is sometimes called the Junior Circuit because it claimed Major League status for the 1901 season , 25 years after the formation of the National League ( the Senior Circuit ) . | Greater Toronto Area: The Greater Toronto Area ( GTA ) is the most populous metropolitan area in Canada . It consists of the central city , Toronto , along with 25 surrounding suburbs , distributed among four regional municipalities : Durham , Halton , Peel , and York . | 2003 World Series: The 99th edition of the World Series , it was a best-of-seven playoff between the National League ( NL ) champion Florida Marlins and the American League ( AL ) champion New York Yankees ; the Marlins upset the heavily-favored Yankees , four games to two . The series was played from October 18 to 25 , 2003 . | 2008 World Series: The AL 's 4-3 win in the 2008 All-Star Game gave the Rays home field advantage for the series , meaning no more than three games would be played at the Phillies ' stadium Citizens Bank Park . The Phillies won their second championship in their 126-year history to bring the city of Philadelphia its first championship in 25 years ( since the 1983 NBA Finals ) . | Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex: The region 's economy is primarily based on banking , commerce , insurance , telecommunications , technology , energy , healthcare , medical research , transportation and logistics .

The games were originally awarded to Denver, Colorado in the United States in 1970, but they withdrew in the wake of Colorado residents voting against it for environmental and cost reasons in November 1972. This led to the International Olympic Committee opening up the bids for the games again, eventually awarding them to Innsbruck in February 1973. The Austrian city, having hosted the Winter Olympics in 1964, was in the process of having the venues used for those Games before Denver's with clear cutting of the alpine skiing venues, lessening of the amount of cross-country skiing routes, upgrading the ski jumps, adding lighting in the indoor sports arena to accommodate color television, and the construction of a combination bobsleigh and luge track. After the 1976 Games, the venues have remained in use, hosting events in Nordic skiing and the sliding sports. They hosted some of the events for the Winter Universiade in 2005 and seven of the eight venues served as host for the first Winter Youth Olympic Games in 2012. passages: Ice hockey at the 1976 Winter Olympics: The men 's ice hockey tournament at the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck , Austria , was the 13th Olympic Championship .

Following the pattern of one release each year of the previous volumes, it was released on October 30, 2007. The four discs in this collection are devoted to themes and subjects the cartoons in each disc have in common. The first disc consists entirely of cartoons starring the two top stars of Warner cartoons, Bugs Bunny and/or Daffy Duck. The second disc consists entirely of cartoons which lampoon fairy tales. The third disc consists entirely of cartoons either directed or co-directed by Bob Clampett. The fourth disc titled Early Daze features rarely seen cartoons from the 1930s and early 1940s which were made in black-and-white. Continuing a pattern which began with Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3, the DVD set has a warning in the beginning of each disc that states that some of the cartoons contain ethnic and racial stereotypes that may be offensive to modern audiences; however, like the fourth volume, the warning is shown on a title card rather than done as a special introduction. This volume did not sell as well as the previous volumes did, mainly due to the slump of the country's economy at this point, and partly due to stiff competition from DVD release of rival studio Pixar's Ratatouille. As a result, it was decided that both this and Volume 6 release outside of North America would be delayed/not occur.

It has been featured in the athletics programme at the Summer Olympics since 1896 for men and since 1964 for women. On a standard outdoor running track, it is one lap around the track. Runners start in staggered positions and race in separate lanes for the entire course. In many countries, athletes previously competed in the 440 yard dash (402.336 m) - which is a quarter of a mile and was referred to as the 'quarter-mile' - instead of the 400 m (437.445 yards), though this distance is now obsolete. Like other sprint disciplines, the 400 m involves the use of starting blocks. The runners take up position in the blocks on the 'ready' command, adopt a more efficient starting posture which isometrically preloads their muscles on the 'set' command, and stride forwards from the blocks upon hearing the starter's pistol. The blocks allow the runners to begin more powerfully and thereby contribute to their overall sprint speed capability. Maximum sprint speed capability is a significant contributing factor to success in the event, but athletes also require substantial speed endurance and the ability to cope well with high amounts of lactic acid to sustain a fast speed over a whole lap. While considered to be predominantly an anaerobic event, there is some aerobic involvement and the degree of aerobic training required for 400 metre athletes is open to debate. The current men's world record is held by Wayde van Niekerk of South Africa, with a time of 43.03 seconds; van Niekerk is also the Olympic champion.

The school's mission is to produce experimental test pilots, flight test engineers, and flight test navigators to lead and conduct test and evaluation of aerospace weapon systems. The school was established on September 9, 1944, as the Flight Test Training Unit at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (AFB) in Dayton, Ohio. To take advantage of the uncongested skies and superb flying weather, the school was moved on February 4, 1951, to its present location at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert of Southern California. Edwards AFB is the home of the Air Force Flight Test Center and has been an integral part of flight testing for over fifty years. Between 1962 and 1972, the Test Pilot School expanded its role to include astronaut training for military test pilots. Thirty-seven TPS graduates of this era were selected for the U.S. space program, and twenty-six went on to earn astronaut's wings by flying in the X-15, Gemini, Apollo, and Space Shuttle programs. Although the school no longer trains astronauts, many TPS graduates since 1972 have been selected by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for duties in space. The school encourages applications from civilians, personnel from other U.S. military services, and individuals from foreign countries. An exchange program allows selected students to attend other test pilot schools including the United States Naval Test Pilot School, the United Kingdom's Empire Test Pilots' School, and France's EPNER. passages: United States Air Force: The United States Air Force ( USAF ) is the aerial warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces . | Major (United States): It is equivalent to the naval rank of lieutenant commander in the other uniformed services .

It has been running continually since 1987-88. The champions are promoted to the Tribute Cornwall/Devon league, and the runner-up plays the second team in Tribute Devon 1, with the winning team gaining promotion. One or two teams are usually relegated to Tribute Cornwall 2. Saltash are the most successful team having won the league on five occasions and have been runner-up three times; they currently play in Tribute Cornwall/Devon.

After Christmas the teams split into two leagues with the top eight playing in Cornwall One and the remainder playing in Cornwall Two. Hayle won both phase one and phase two, winning the title with two matches to play. They are promoted to the Cornwall/Devon league, following their relegation from that league in 2015-16.

The elder Kaplan earned his fortune primarily through operations in Cuba and the Dominican Republic . The J.M . Kaplan Fund ( named after the elder of the two ) was found in a 1964 Congressional investigation to be a conduit for funneling CIA money to Latin America , including through the Institute of International Research headed by Norman Thomas , six-time Presidential candidate for the Socialist Party of America . In May 1961 , the ruler of the Dominican Republic , Rafael Trujillo was murdered with weapons supplied by the CIA . The CIA described its role in changing the government of the Dominican Republic as a 'success ' in that it assisted in moving the Dominican Republic from a totalitarian dictatorship to a Western-style democracy . In November 1961 , Mexican police found a corpse they identified as Luis Melchior Vidal , Jr. , godson of Trujillo . Vidal was the unofficial business agent of the Dominican Republic while Trujillo was in power . Under cover of the American Sucrose Company and the Paint Company of America , Vidal had teamed up with the American , Joel David Kaplan , to operate as arms merchants for the CIA . In 1962 , the younger Kaplan was convicted of killing Vidal , in Mexico City . Kaplan was held at the Santa Martha Acatitla prison in the Iztapalapa borough of the Mexico City D.F . region . Joel 's sister , Judy Kaplan , attempted to secure his release in numerous ways , finally developing an audacious plot . On August 19 , 1971 , a helicopter landed in the prison yard . The guards mistakenly thought this was an official visit . In two minutes , Kaplan and Kaplan 's cellmate Carlos Antonio Contreras Castro , a Venezuelan counterfeiter , boarded the craft and were piloted away . No shots were fired . Both men were flown to Texas and then different planes flew Kaplan to California and Castro to Guatemala . The Mexican government never initiated extradition proceedings against Kaplan . The escape is told in a book , The 10-Second Jailbreak : The Helicopter Escape of Joel David Kaplan . It also inspired the 1975 action movie Breakout , which starred Charles Bronson and Robert Duvall\n1    October 31 , 1973                                               Mountjoy Jail         Ireland       Yes                               JB O'Hagan Seamus Twomey Kevin Mallon                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          On October 31 , 1973 an IRA member hijacked a helicopter and forced the pilot to land in the exercise yard of Dublin 's Mountjoy Jail 's D Wing at 3:40 p.m. , October 31 , 1973 . Three members of the IRA were able to escape : JB O'Hagan , Seamus Twomey and Kevin Mallon .

She demanded that he land in the Orsainville prison courtyard , where her boyfriend ( awaiting extradition to California on a murder charge ) was set to escape . The pilot , Brian Jenner , feigned a panic attack , put the helicopter through some rough maneuvers and was then able to convince Paquet , in the back seat of the Jet Ranger , to turn over her shotgun and her knife . Jenner then gave her the choice of any landing spot , except the prison . She chose to go back to the airport . The pilot then explained , in great detail , exactly where they were and where they would be landing on arrival at the Quebec City airport . He added that the police would surely be aware by then , that she had hijacked the helicopter but would not yet be aware that she had given up her arms to the pilot . All the time Jenner was squeezing the transmit button on his cyclic stick and the tower was picking up all the details . The moment they touched down at the airport , the woman bailed from the helicopter but the police , who had been advised of the situation by the control tower , were hiding out all over the place and captured Paquet within seconds\n5       January , 1983                                     Pentridge ( HM Prison )       Australia        No                                                      David McMillan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Arrests were made for the 1983 attempted helicopter escape from Melbournes Pentridge Prison in Australia . The three , all held on drug-importation charges , had hired a former SAS soldier , then living in the Philippines , to lift the prisoners from the jails tennis court to a nearby van fitted with panels to hide them for the 600 kilometre road trip to Sydney , where a yacht was to take them to Manila . The plan was thwarted when Lord Tony Moynihan , himself an exile in the Philippines , informed the Australian Federal Police , who then ran it as a sting operation . Tony Moynihan would later become an informer against Howard Marks in a Florida trial . Of the accused , only David McMillan and his accountant friend who had visited the prison stood trial . During the hearings , few prosecution witnesses used their real names as they were mostly from Moynihans former West African MI6 unit .

The 3-passenger helicopter was so overloaded with 5 occupants that it barely cleared the fence , while flying away in a hail of gunfire that injured one guard .

He made his way to the roof by threatening guards with a fake pistol and nectarines painted as grenades . On top of the jail he was picked up by his wife Nadine , who had taken helicopter pilot lessons especially for the escape . They landed at a nearby football pitch and fled in a waiting car .

McIntosh walked away from a minimum security prison on October 28 and then rented a helicopter on November 5 . He used the helicopter to free Samantha Lopez from the Federal Correctional Institution at Dublin , east of San Francisco . Both were later caught on November 15 when they arrived to pick up wedding rings from a California shopping mall . The authorities were monitoring the account McIntosh used to write the check and the police were waiting for them . Ron McIntosh for his role in the escape was sentenced to 25 years in prison . Samantha Lopez was given five years added to her 50-year sentence for a 1981 bank robbery in Georgia . As they were driven away to their separate prisons McIntosh was able to lean out of a car window and yell , I love you ! to Lopez .

The pilot hovered the helicopter three feet off the courtyard ground while around 50 inmates were exercising . While the hijackers laid covering fire , three inmates tried to board the helicopter . One escapee , Andre Bellaiche , 36 , was a Tunisian-born Frenchman who was in jail for murder and bank robbery . The other escapee , Gianluigi Esposito , 30 , was an arms smuggler accused of providing weapons to Italian terrorists . The third man , Luciano Cipollari , 24 , an Italian extradited from France in 1985 for murder , slipped and fell preventing him from escaping . The helicopter flew to a nearby soccer field scattering an ongoing game . The men ran out of the helicopter and hijacked a car to escape .

As he was flying his Aerospatiale Gazelle helicopter she pulled a gun and forced him to land in the courtyard of the Santa Fe prison . Three inmates jumped in and he flew the aircraft to another site , pursued by a US Customs Service helicopter that was later joined by a state police helicopter . Pursuing helicopters claimed that Bella tried to force them down through aggressive maneuvers . However , they were able to tail him and police were waiting for the helicopter every time it touched down . Two of the prisoners , Francis Mitchell and Randy Lackey , were captured almost right away while Danny Mahoney was later captured with assistance from a canine unit\n13     April 17 , 1989                       Federal Holding Facility , Miami , FL   United States        No                                                          Ben Kramer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Famous Apache Boat owner and racer Ben Kramer tried to escape by helicopter from the Metropolitan Correctional Center , a Federal Prison ( holding ) in Southwest Miami on April 17 , 1989 . The escape failed when the rookie pilot , Charles Clayton Stevens , hovered 12 inches off the ground in a very tight space ( 200'long by 50 ' wide ) . When the 6'-2 , 240 lb Kramer jumped into the small two seater Bell 47 D-1 ( trainer ) , its rear rotor struck the razor wire , causing it to be uncontrollable . Stevens made an attempt to take off anyway . One of the skids caught on the razor wire , causing the helicopter to catapult over the fence and crash into the prison grounds . Both pilot and escapee sustained extensive injuries . Ben Kramer was serving life without parole for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ( RICO ) charges resulting from drug trafficking , and also pleaded guilty to the murder of fellow boat builder and racer Don Aronow , owner of Cigarette Off Shore Boats\n14    August 19 , 1989                       Arkansas Valley Correctional Facility   United States       Yes                                        Ralph Brown Freddie Gonzales                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Colorado prison inmates Ralph Brown and Freddie Gonzales were able to escape via helicopter .

It returned to its base , from where the hijackers escaped in a car\nterms_explanation:\n\ntable_summary:\n\ntable_context:\nList of helicopter prison escapes | Actual attempts |  | A helicopter prison escape is made when an inmate escapes from a prison by means of a helicopter. This list includes prisoner escapes where a helicopter was used in an attempt to free prisoners from a place of internment, a prison or correctional facility. One of the earliest instances of using a helicopter to escape a prison was the escape of Joel David Kaplan, nicknamed Man Fan, on August 19, 1971 from the Santa Martha Acatitla in Mexico. Kaplan was a New York businessman who not only successfully escaped the prison but eventually escaped Mexico and went on to write a book about his experience, The 10-Second Jailbreak. France has had more recorded helicopter escape attempts than any other country, with at least 11. One of the most notable French jail breaks occurred in 1986, when the wife of bank robber Michel Vaujour studied for months to learn how to fly a helicopter. Using her newly acquired skills, she rented a white helicopter and flew low over Paris to pluck her husband off the roof of his fortress prison. Vaujour was later seriously wounded in a shootout with police, and his pilot wife was arrested. The record for most helicopter escapes goes to convicted murderer Pascal Payet, who has used helicopters to escape from prisons in 2001, 2003, and most recently 2007. Another multiple helicopter escapee is Vasilis Paleokostas who on February 22, 2009 escaped for the second time from the same prison. Because of this, many prisons have taken applicable precautions, such as nets or cables strung over open prison courtyards. passages: ", "label": "William Lane"}

The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) includes all Asian countries except Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Georgia, Israel, Kazakhstan and Turkey as members, but also includes the Oceanian countries of Australia, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands (the association of the Northern Mariana Islands is a provisional associate member of AFC but not a member of FIFA). The football associations of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Georgia, Israel, Kazakhstan and Turkey are members of UEFA, the European football confederation (Israel and Kazakhstan were previously AFC members but had left). Hong Kong and Macau, the special administrative regions of the China, have their own football associations which are members of AFC. Taiwan (called Chinese Taipei in the international sports community) and Palestine, both members of the IOC but not the UN, also have their own football associations which are members of AFC. Each of the AFC member countries have their own football league systems. The clubs playing in each top-level league compete for the title as the country's club champions, and also for places in next season's AFC club competitions, i.e., the AFC Champions League, the AFC Cup, and the AFC President's Cup. Due to promotion and relegation, the clubs playing in the top-level league are different every season; however, some league systems (such as Australia) do not have promotion and relegation. The champions of the previous season in each country are listed in bold. Please note: Some clubs play in a national football league other than their own country's. Where this is the case the club is noted as such. In particular, the Australian A-League includes a team from New Zealand, whose national federation is a member of the Oceania Football Confederation. passages: ", "label": "5,000"}

The remaining eight are operated in cooperation with other public and private organizations. [a]\n The first Pennsylvania state park, at Valley Forge, opened in 1893 and was given to the National Park Service (NPS) for America's bicentennial in 1976. There are a total of seventeen former Pennsylvania state parks: four former parks have been transferred to the NPS, four to the Pennsylvania Historical Museum Commission, two to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, one to both the Corps and the Pennsylvania Game Commission, five to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry, and one has ceased to exist. Nine current and two former state parks have had major name changes or have been known under alternate names. The list gives an overview of Pennsylvania state parks and a brief history of their development since the first park opened in 1893. State parks range in size from 3 acres (1.2 ha) to 21,122 acres (8,548 ha), with nearly one percent (0.96%) of Pennsylvania's land as state park land. According to Dan Cupper (1993), Pennsylvania is the thirty-third largest state, but only Alaska and California have more park land. passages: Mercer County, Pennsylvania: As of the 2010 census , the population was 116,638 .

Operated by the San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni), a part of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA), Muni Metro served an average of 166,900 passengers per weekday in the second quarter of 2013, making it the third-busiest light rail system in the United States. Two subway stations, West Portal Station and Forest Hill Station, and five of the six light-rail lines, J Church, K Ingleside, L Taraval, M Ocean View, and N Judah, are remnants of an extensive streetcar system that survived the mass conversion to buses in the 1950s. In 1980, seven subway stations, from Embarcadero Station to Castro Street Station, were opened with the inauguration of the Market Street Subway underneath Market Street, marking the conversion of San Francisco's streetcar system into the Muni Metro. In 1998, four surface stations on The Embarcadero opened, connecting the newly constructed AT&T Park (then called Pacific Bell Park) and Caltrain to Muni Metro. In 2007, the T Third Street line was started along 18 new surface stations built along new track laid from Caltrain down the eastern side of the city to the city line. The system consists of nine subway stations and twenty-four surface stations with high-level 34-inch (860 mm) platforms that allow for level boarding. There are also eighty-seven surface stops whose features vary anywhere between low-level platforms, traffic islands, and markers painted on nearby utility poles. Four stations, from Embarcadero to Civic Center, are shared with Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART). The oldest stations are Forest Hill and West Portal, built in 1918, while the newest stations were opened as part as the Third Street Light Rail Project in 2007. passages: ", "label": "J Church K Ingleside"}

The country fielded thirty-two athletes in cross-country skiing, biathlon, and alpine skiing. Russia placed first overall in the total medal count, winning thirty-eight medals overall. Russia's success at the Vancouver Paralympics stood in sharp contrast with its disappointing performance at the Vancouver Olympics the previous month, attracting media attention. The Moscow Times noted the irony in the fact that there had been high hope for Russia's Winter Olympians, while fairly little attention had been paid to its Paralympians, until their performance stood out with a crop of medals. While the Moscow Times focused on the difficulties faced by the country's Paralympians in their everyday life, however, the Vancouver Sun remarked: Unlike Canada and other countries where almost all Paralympians must have jobs, Team Russia's competitors are akin to 'sports professionals'. Most don't work so they can focus solely on their training, which is funded by the state and individual sponsors. With Sochi being the host city of the 2014 Winter Paralympics, a Russian segment was performed at the closing ceremony. passages: Biathlon at the 2010 Winter Paralympics: The biathlon competition of the Vancouver 2010 Paralympics was held at Whistler , British Columbia . | ", "label": "17"}

This was the nation's eighteenth appearance at the Olympics, having not competed at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. Comité Olímpico Colombiano sent the nation's largest delegation to the Games, surpassing the record by having more than a quarter more athletes than represented Colombia in Beijing. A total of 104 athletes, 48 men and 56 women, competed in 18 sports. Women's football was the only team-based sport in which Colombia was represented in these Olympic Games. There was only a single competitor in fencing, shooting, table tennis, taekwondo and triathlon. This was Colombia's most successful Olympics (until Rio 2016), winning a total of eight medals (one gold, three silver, and four bronze). BMX rider and world champion Mariana Pajón, who was Colombia's flag bearer at the opening ceremony, won the nation's first gold medal since the 2000 Summer Olympics. Freestyle wrestler Jackeline Rentería became the first Colombian female athlete to claim two Olympic medals, while triple jumper Caterine Ibargüen won the nation's second medal in the track and field after 20 years. Other notable accomplishments included the nation's first ever Olympic medals in road cycling, judo and taekwondo. passages: ", "label": "4"}

It includes notable churches either where a church means a congregation (in the New Testament definition) or where a church means a building (in the colloquial sense). It also includes campgrounds and conference centers and retreats that are significant Methodist gathering places, including a number of historic sites of camp meetings. This very limited list includes only historically or architecturally significant buildings, and omits many of the currently very largest and influential congregations which do not meet that standard. Methodism was founded with a large component being a rejection of past churches and was developed by John Wesley and others in large open-air gatherings in Great Britain. In the United States, Methodists (along with Baptists and other Protestants) were major participants in the Second Great Awakening wherein people would travel from a large area to a particular site to camp out, listen to itinerant preachers, and pray. The list also includes selected notable Methodist theological buildings. In the United States, numerous Methodist churches are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and on state and local historic registers, many reflecting the values of plainness, of Gothic architecture, of simple adornment. The Greek Revival style is also simple and came to be adopted for numerous American Methodist churches. passages: Winton Place Methodist Episcopal Church: Two of the most important events in the history of this church building occurred after Hannaford 's death .

[ 19 ] The default list order is arranged by the position numbers used by official baseball scorekeepers ( i.e. , 1 – pitcher , 2 – catcher , etc . ) . | An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each position - who in turn are given the honorific All-America and typically referred to as All-American athletes, or simply All-Americans. Although the honorees generally do not compete as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. In 1950, the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) selected its first All-American baseball team. It has since chosen All-American teams and a player of the year for each division (National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I, Division II, Division III, National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, junior college and high school). In 1991, Collegiate Baseball began selecting college All-American, Freshman All-American, and High School All-American teams. Baseball America has selected - since 1981 - pre-season and post-season All-American teams and College Player of the Year honorees. Various organizations selected All-American lists of the best players for the 1991 NCAA Division I college baseball season. The ABCA, the magazine Baseball America, and Collegiate Baseball were the NCAA-sanctioned selectors. This list only includes players selected to the post-season All-American first team for each selector. However, many All-American selections choose second, third, etc. teams from the remaining eligible candidates. passages: ", "label": "Bill Blanchette"}

The Chinese Super League was created by the rebranding of the former top division Chinese Football Association Jia-A League in 2004 (see Chinese Jia-A League, not to be confused with Chinese Football Association Jia League, which is the current second tier league). Originally contested by 12 teams in its inaugural year, the league has since expanded, with 16 teams competing in the current season. A total of 31 teams have competed in the CSL since its inception. Only seven teams of them have won the title: Guangzhou Evergrande (8), \nShandong Luneng (3), Beijing Guoan (1), Shanghai SIPG (1), Shenzhen Jianlibao (1), Dalian Shide (1), Changchun Yatai (1). The current Super League champions are Guangzhou Evergrande. The Chinese Super League is one of the most popular professional sports leagues in China, with an average attendance of 24,107 for league matches in the 2018 season. This is the twelfth-highest of any domestic professional sports league in the world and the sixth-highest of any professional association football league in the world, behind Bundesliga, Premier League, La Liga, Serie A and Liga MX. The League is now running under the authorization of the Chinese Football Association, The CSL Company, which is currently the commercial branch of the League, is a corporation in which the CFA and all of the member clubs act as shareholders. It is planned that the CFA will ultimately transfer their shares of The CSL Company to the clubs and professional union which consists of CSL clubs will be established as the League's management entity.

The USL is sanctioned by the United States Soccer Federation (U.S. Soccer) as a Division II Professional League since 2017, placing it under Major League Soccer (Division I) in the hierarchy. The USL is headquartered in Tampa, Florida. The league is owned and operated by United Soccer League (originally United Soccer Leagues) and was formed as result of the merger of their USL First (USL-1) and Second Divisions (USL-2), following the controversial 2010 season which saw neither the USL-1 nor the North American Soccer League (NASL) receive Division II sanctioning from the USSF, resulting in the temporary USSF Division 2 Pro League. United Soccer Leagues stated that the merger would strengthen the league's position within the American professional soccer landscape through stability, commercial growth and the professional development of soccer in four main regions throughout the United States and Canada. Formerly known as United Soccer League (USL) and USL Pro, in January 2013, United Soccer Leagues and MLS reached an agreement to integrate the USL league competition with the MLS Reserve League, primarily to improve player development in North America, strengthen league competition and build ties between leagues in the American soccer pyramid. This multi-year deal encourages MLS and USL team affiliations and player loans, aiming to have more games for teams and developing players. As of the 2020 season, 14 USL Championship teams are affiliated to MLS teams.

It covers an area from the Allegheny Mountains in the east across the Cumberland Plateau to the Pottsville Escarpment in the west. The region is known for its coal mining; most family farms in the region have disappeared since the introduction of surface mining in the 1940s and 1950s. The Daniel Boone National Forest is located on rough but beautiful terrain along and east of the Pottsville Escarpment. There are many natural arches and sandstone cliffs that are excellent for rock climbing and rappeling. The Red River Gorge, part of the National Forest, is known worldwide in rock climbing circles. The Sheltowee Trace Trail runs 420-430 km (260-270 mi) north and south, through the region.

The first alumnus of the United States Military Academy (USMA) to perform actions to be recognized with the Medal of Honor was Charles Henry Tompkins, a non-graduating member of the class of 1851, while the last alumnus to perform actions so recognized was Andre Lucas, a graduating member of the class of 1954. There are ten wars involving the United States for which the Medal of Honor has been bestowed upon a USMA alumnus. More than half of the alumni who received the distinction were thereby recognized for actions in either the American Civil War or the American Indian Wars; twenty-five alumni were awarded the medal in connection with the Civil War and twenty-one in connection with the Indian Wars. Four alumni were recognized for their contributions to the Spanish-American War, nine for the Philippine-American War, two for the Boxer Rebellion, and one for the Banana Wars. While only one alumnus received the Medal of Honor for actions in World War I, ten alumni were so recognized for actions in World War II. The final two conflicts for which the Medal of Honor was given to USMA alumni are the Korean War, for which two alumni were recognized, and the Vietnam War, for which eight alumni were recognized. Of the eighty-three USMA alumni who have received the Medal of Honor, eight were non-graduates: John Cleveland Robinson, Charles Henry Tompkins, John Alexander Logan, Jr., Louis J. Van Schaick, Eli Thompson Fryer, Michael J. Daly, Roger Donlon, and James A. Gardner. Two graduates, John Gregory Bourke (class of 1869) and Calvin Pearl Titus (class of 1905), received the Medal of Honor before being appointed to the academy. Other notable Academy alumni who received the Medal of Honor include William Harding Carter, Douglas MacArthur, and Humbert Roque Versace. passages: ", "label": "1873"}

The draft was held from April 30 to May 1, 1966, so that the newly founded Chicago Bulls could acquire players for the upcoming 1966-67 season. Chicago had been awarded the expansion team on January 16, 1966. The Bulls were the third NBA franchise to play in Chicago, following the Chicago Stags, which folded in 1950, and the Chicago Packers-Zephyrs, which moved to Baltimore and became the Baltimore Bullets in 1963. In addition, the Bullets relocated to Washington in 1973 as the Capital Bullets, then became the Washington Bullets a year later, before becoming the Washington Wizards in 1997. In an NBA expansion draft, new NBA teams are allowed to acquire players from the previously established teams in the league. Not all players on a given team are available during an expansion draft, since each team can protect a certain number of players from being selected. Before the 1966 expansion draft, the Bulls' general manager, Dick Klein, asked that each team reduce the number of protected players from eight (as initially planned) to seven. In exchange, he agreed to pick last (instead of first) in each round of that year's college draft. He also promised Red Auerbach of the Boston Celtics that he would not draft Boston's K. C. Jones, as long as Auerbach met with him to share his opinions of other players throughout the NBA. The Bulls selected eighteen unprotected players, two from each of the nine other NBA teams. On the first day of the draft, they selected players from the Eastern Division teams; on the second day, they picked from the Western Division teams. passages: Los Angeles Lakers: The Lakers compete in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) , as a member of the league 's Western Conference in the Pacific Division .

It was the final race of the 2004 season and the first time that a GP in Brazil was not one of the first three rounds of an F1 season, and local fans were delighted when Brazil's Rubens Barrichello took pole for his home race. It would be Barrichello's first non-retirement at Interlagos in ten years, his previous finish at the circuit being at the season opener in 1994. The early laps were held in changeable conditions, and the race ended up as a duel between Kimi Räikkönen and Juan Pablo Montoya, who were to be McLaren teammates for 2005. The Colombian took victory in his final race for Williams, which was also the last win for the Williams team until the 2012 Spanish Grand Prix.

While the city limits are entirely in northern Prince George's County, outlying developments extend into Anne Arundel, Montgomery and Howard counties. Founded as a mill town in the early 19th century, Laurel expanded local industry and was later able to become an early commuter town for Washington and Baltimore workers following the arrival of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1835. Largely residential today, the city maintains a historic district centered on its Main Street, highlighting its industrial past.

The Walt Disney Studios releases films from Disney-owned and non-Disney owned animation studios. Most films listed below are from Walt Disney Animation Studios which began as the feature animation department of Walt Disney Productions, producing its first feature-length animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937 and as of 2020 has produced a total of 58 feature films. [st 1] Beginning with Toy Story in 1995, The Walt Disney Studios also released animated films by Pixar Animation Studios, which Disney acquired in 2006. On March 20, 2019, The Walt Disney Studios acquired Blue Sky Studios as part of its acquisition of 21st Century Fox, as well as 20th Century Fox Animation which operates as a label within 20th Century Fox. Other studio units have also released films theatrically, namely Walt Disney Television Animation's Disney MovieToons/Video Premiere unit (now DisneyToon Studios) and the studio's distribution unit, which acquires film rights from outside animation studios to release films under the Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone Pictures, 20th Century Fox or previously owned Miramax film labels. [citation needed] In 1996, The Walt Disney Studios signed a deal with Tokuma Shoten for distribution rights to the theatrical works of Studio Ghibli worldwide (excluding Asia except for Japan and Taiwan and excluding Grave of the Fireflies which was not published by Tokuma), including what then was the most recent film, Princess Mononoke. The deal later grew to include DVD rights and newer Ghibli movies, however Studio Ghibli remains wholly independent of Disney and maintains strict creative control over the handling of the foreign language localization Disney produces. All of the theatrical Ghibli back catalog originally included in the deal have since been released to DVD in North America and several other countries. The deal ended however with indie distributor GKIDS taking over home media distribution in 2017, with it already handling theatre distribution since 2010. Other studios globally have released films through Walt Disney Pictures which maintains distribution rights in certain territories. passages: The Adventures of Tom Thumb and Thumbelina: The Adventures of Tom Thumb and Thumbelina is a 2002 direct-to-video animated film directed by Glenn Chaika and starring Elijah Wood , Jennifer Love Hewitt , Peter Gallagher , and Jon Stewart . | ", "label": "Buena Vista Home Video"}

The United States has sent diplomatic representatives to China since 1844, when Caleb Cushing, as commissioner, negotiated the Treaty of Wanghia. Commissioners represented the United States in China from 1844 to 1857. Until 1898, the Qing Empire did not have a system in place for the Emperor to accept the Letters of Credence of foreign representatives. From 1858 to 1935, the U.S. representative in China was formally Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to China. The American legation in Nanjing was upgraded to an embassy in 1935 and the Envoy was promoted to Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary. During the republican era, the U.S. recognized the Beiyang Government in Beijing from 1912 to 1928 and the Nationalist Government in Nanjing (and Chongqing from 1937 to 1945) from 1928 onwards. After the Communist People's Republic of China was established in mainland China in 1949 and the Kuomintang moved the Republic of China government from Nanjing to Taipei, Taiwan, the U.S. continued to recognize the Republic of China as the legitimate Chinese government and maintained its embassy in Taiwan. However, in 1973, the U.S. established a Liaison Office in Beijing to represent its interests in mainland China. In 1976, the Chief of the Liaison Office was promoted to the rank of ambassador. In December 1978, the U.S. severed official relations with the Republic of China and in January 1979, established formal relations with the People's Republic of China. The U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing was upgraded to an embassy on March 1, 1979. passages: Indiana: Indiana has several metropolitan areas with populations greater than 100,000 and a number of smaller industrial cities and towns . | ", "label": "Indianapolis"}

It is classed as a supermax or control unit prison, where the safety of inmates and staff is paramount. It is located in unincorporated Fremont County, Colorado, near Florence, and opened in 1994, and it is informally known as the Alcatraz of the Rockies. The Federal Bureau of Prisons needed a unit designed specifically for the secure housing of those prisoners most capable of violence toward staff or other inmates. As of December 2019[update], there are 376 prisoners who spend 23 hours per day in single cells with facilities made of poured concrete to deter self-harm, and 24-hour supervision, carried out intensively with high staff-inmate ratios. Phones are generally banned and only limited broadcast entertainment is permitted. After three years in maximum confinement, some prisoners may be transferred to a less restrictive prison. The aim is to encourage reasonably peaceful behavior from the most violent career prisoners. passages: James Marcello: James J.

Since it was first awarded to Arthur Rose Eldred on August 21, 1912, Eagle Scout has been earned by more than two million youth. The list below includes notable recipients. As of 2014[update], requirements include earning at least 21 merit badges and demonstrating Scout Spirit, leadership, and service. The requirements include an Eagle Scout Service Project where the Scout must further demonstrate service and leadership. Eagle Scouts are recognized with a medal and a cloth badge that visibly recognizes the accomplishments of the Scout. Eagle Palms are a further recognition, awarded for completing additional tenure, leadership, and merit badge requirements. Typically adult volunteers who have received the Eagle award as a youth wear a smaller patch depicting a square knot. The Distinguished Eagle Scout Award (DESA) is bestowed to Eagle Scouts for nationally renowned distinguished service in their profession and to the community for a period of at least 25 years after earning the Eagle Scout rank. Since its introduction in 1969 by the National Eagle Scout Association, the DESA has been awarded to just under 2000 Eagle Scouts. [a]\n The NESA Outstanding Eagle Scout Award (NOESA) is bestowed to Eagle Scouts who have distinguished themselves at a local-to-regional level or who have not yet met the 25-year tenure requirement to be considered for a DESA.

There are 38 National Historic Landmarks (NHLs) in Alabama, which are located in 18 of the state's 67 counties. Five of the NHLs in the state have military significance, eight are significant examples of a particular architectural style, six are archaeological sites, seven played a role in the African American struggle for civil rights, and five are associated with the development of the U.S. Space Program. One site in Alabama was designated a NHL, but the designation was subsequently removed. The National Historic Landmark program is administered by the National Park Service, a branch of the Department of the Interior. The National Park Service determines which properties meet NHL criteria and makes nomination recommendations after an owner notification process. The Secretary of the Interior reviews nominations and, based on a set of predetermined criteria, makes a decision on NHL designation or a determination of eligibility for designation. Both public and privately owned properties are designated as NHLs. This designation provides indirect, partial protection of the historic integrity of the properties, via tax incentives, grants, monitoring of threats, and other means. Owners may object to the nomination of the property as a NHL. When this is the case the Secretary of the Interior can only designate a site as eligible for designation. NHLs are also included on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), historic properties that the National Park Service deems to be worthy of preservation. passages: Mobile, Alabama: As of 2011 [ update ] , the population within a 60-mile ( 100 km ) radius of Mobile is 1,262,907 .

It is the 8th most extensive and 21st most populous U.S. state. The estimated population of Colorado is 5,770,545 as of 2019, an increase of 14.7% since the 2010 United States Census. The state was named for the Colorado River, which early Spanish explorers named the Río Colorado (Red River) for the ruddy silt the river carried from the mountains. The Territory of Colorado was organized on February 28, 1861, and on August 1, 1876, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant signed Proclamation 230 admitting Colorado to the Union as the 38th state. Colorado is nicknamed the Centennial State because it became a state one century after the signing of the United States Declaration of Independence. Colorado is bordered by Wyoming to the north, Nebraska to the northeast, Kansas to the east, Oklahoma to the southeast, New Mexico to the south, Utah to the west, and touches Arizona to the southwest at the Four Corners. Colorado is noted for its vivid landscape of mountains, forests, high plains, mesas, canyons, plateaus, rivers and desert lands. Colorado is part of the western and southwestern United States and is one of the Mountain States. Denver is the capital and most populous city of Colorado. Residents of the state are known as Coloradans, although the antiquated term Coloradoan is occasionally used. passages: Colorado Mammoth: They are owned by Stan Kroenke , who is also the owner of the Colorado Avalanche , Denver Nuggets and the Colorado Rapids of MLS .

The Republic of Chile is currently a democratic, representative and unitary state that is located in the extreme southwest of South America. In its history, the Chilean nation has been involved in several wars, meaning an armed struggle between two or more sides, which may be conventional or unconventional. passages: Peru: Peru formally proclaimed independence in 1821 , and following the military campaigns of José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar , and the decisive battle of Ayacucho , Peru completed its independence in 1824 . In the ensuing years , the country enjoyed relative economic and political stability , which ended shortly before the War of the Pacific with Chile . | Bolivia: Its geography varies from the peaks of the Andes in the West , to the Eastern Lowlands , situated within the Amazon Basin . It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil , to the southeast by Paraguay , to the south by Argentina , to the southwest by Chile , and to the northwest by Peru . | Pincheira brothers: The gang fought initially in the Chilean War of Independence as royalist guerrillas during the Guerra a muerte phase . After Vicente Benavides was executed and the royalist resistance collapsed , they became armed bandits who sought to live outside the new states of Chile and Argentina . | Mapuche: Their influence once extended from the Aconcagua River to the Chiloé Island and spread later eastward to the Argentine pampa . Today the collective group makes up over 80% of the indigenous peoples in Chile , and about 9% of the total Chilean population . | Chilean Civil War of 1829–1830: The Chilean Civil War of 1829-1830 ( Spanish : Guerra Civil de 1829-1830 ) was a civil war in Chile fought between conservative Pelucones and liberal Pipiolos forces in Chile over the constitutional regime in force . | Diego Portales: As a minister of president José Joaquín Prieto , Diego Portales played a pivotal role in shaping the state and government politics in the 19th century , delivering with the Constitution of 1833 the framework of the Chilean state for almost a century . Portales ' influential political stance included unitarianism , presidentialism and conservatism which led to consolidate Chile as a constitutional authoritarian republic with democracy restricted to include only upper class men . | War of the Confederation: During the war , one of Santa Cruz 's subordinates , General Luis José de Orbegoso , rebelled against him in 1838 to restore Peru with a new government . However , by not allying with Chile , he ended up being defeated by Chilean forces . | Peru–Bolivian Confederation: The War of the Confederation was triggered shortly after its formation when Chile and Argentina independently invaded the country . Argentina was defeated in 1837 , but a combined force of Chile and North Peruvian dissidents known as the United Restoration Army were victorious at the Battle of Yungay in January 1839 , which de facto ended the confederation as Peru and Bolivia were restored as independent states , and Santa Cruz fled into exile . | Liberal Party (Chile, 1849–1966): The Liberal Party ( Partido Liberal ) of Chile was a Chilean political party created by a faction of pipiolos in 1849 . | Chincha Islands War: The Chincha Islands War , also known as Spanish-South American War ( Spanish : Guerra hispano-sudamericana ) , was a series of coastal and naval battles between Spain and its former colonies of Peru and Chile from 1864 to 1866 . | War of the Pacific: Peru , bound to Bolivia by their secret treaty of alliance from 1873 , tried to mediate , but on 1 March 1879 Bolivia declared war on Chile and called on Peru to activate their alliance , while Chile demanded that Peru declare its neutrality . | Chilean Civil War of 1891: The Chilean Civil War of 1891 ( also known as Revolution of 1891 ) was a civil war in Chile fought between forces supporting Congress and forces supporting the President , José Manuel Balmaceda from 16 January 1891 to 18 September 1891 . | ", "label": "Chile"}

These include local, international, direct-to-video and TV releases, and (in certain cases) online releases. They include their scores on Rotten Tomatoes, the region in which they were released (for foreign adaptations), approximate budget, their approximate box office revenue (for theatrical releases), distributor of the film, and the publisher of the original game at the time the film was made (this means that publishers may change between two adaptations of the same game or game series, such as Mortal Kombat). Also included are short films, cutscene films (made up of cutscenes and cinematics from the actual games), documentaries with video games as their subjects and films in which video games play a large part (such as Tron or WarGames). Films based on video games have often received negative reviews. Rotten Tomatoes's 2019 list titled Video Game Movies Ranked Worst to Best included only 3 films that received a fresh Tomatometer rating.

The award was given only to the album producer, and to the composer and lyricist who wrote at least 51% of the music which had not been recorded previously. Over the years, the qualifications for the individual nominees has fluctuated with principal artists, composers, and producers at one point being the sole eligible nominee, to the more recent standard which includes those whose contributions accounted for the majority of the album. As of 2012, the award description is as follows: Award to the principal vocalist(s) and the album producer(s) of 51% or more playing time of the album. The lyricist(s) and composer(s) of a new score are eligible for an Award if they have written and/or composed a new score which comprises 51% or more playing time of the album. Therefore, composers and lyricists are ineligible when recordings contain a majority of previously released material (revivals, collected works). Also, while they are not listed among the nominees, since 2001 the Recording Academy has awarded an official Grammy to the engineers/mixers of the winning Album. Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were handed out, for music released in the previous year.

[ 18 ] | The Blaenplwyf transmitting station (sometimes written Blaen Plwyf or Blaen-Plwyf) is a broadcasting and telecommunications facility located near the village of Blaenplwyf about 10 kilometres (6 mi) to the south west of the town of Aberystwyth, in Ceredigion, Wales (grid reference SN569756). It was originally built by the BBC, entering service in October 1956 acting as a main transmitter for BBC Band II VHF FM radio. It had been planned that the BBC's 405-line VHF television service would commence on the same date, but delays at Rowridge caused the official switch-on to happen six months later on 29 April 1957. Blaenplwyf was considered a main transmitter for VHF television (despite radiating only 3 kW ERP) as it was fed from a microwave link from Mynydd Pencarreg just south of Lampeter. The facility is now owned and operated by Arqiva. The site has a 152 metres (499 ft) guyed steel lattice mast standing on land that is itself 175 metres (574 ft) above sea level. The television and radio broadcasts were originally designed to cover the majority of the Cardigan Bay coastline, the antennas being designed for maximum ERP to the north and to the south-west. Blaenplwyf became a main transmitter for UHF analogue colour television from 1970 onwards, and was transmitting all three original UHF channels in colour from mid 1973. It currently carries all six UK digital television multiplexes. passages: BBC Radio Wales: The station 's managing editor is Colin Paterson . | ", "label": "316,000 listeners"}

It includes notable churches either where a church means a congregation (in the New Testament definition) or where a church means a building (in the colloquial sense). It also includes campgrounds and conference centers and retreats that are significant Methodist gathering places, including a number of historic sites of camp meetings. This very limited list includes only historically or architecturally significant buildings, and omits many of the currently very largest and influential congregations which do not meet that standard. Methodism was founded with a large component being a rejection of past churches and was developed by John Wesley and others in large open-air gatherings in Great Britain. In the United States, Methodists (along with Baptists and other Protestants) were major participants in the Second Great Awakening wherein people would travel from a large area to a particular site to camp out, listen to itinerant preachers, and pray. The list also includes selected notable Methodist theological buildings. In the United States, numerous Methodist churches are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and on state and local historic registers, many reflecting the values of plainness, of Gothic architecture, of simple adornment. The Greek Revival style is also simple and came to be adopted for numerous American Methodist churches. passages: Middlefork Methodist Episcopal Church: Middlefork Methodist Episcopal Church is a historic church on the South of US 169 on the east side of Middle Fork , Grand Road in Redding , Iowa , United States . | ", "label": "Middlefork United Methodist Church"}

Since turning professional in 1992, he has won five World Championships, a record seven Masters titles, and a record seven UK Championships, setting a record total of 19 titles in Triple Crown tournaments. He shares the record for the most ranking titles (36) with Stephen Hendry and also holds the record as the youngest winner of a ranking title (1993 UK Championship, aged 17 years and 358 days) as well as the youngest winner of the Masters (in 1995, aged 19 years and 69 days). In the 2017/2018 season, O'Sullivan won five ranking events in a single season, a record that he shares with Hendry, Ding Junhui and Mark Selby. His career prize money of over £11 million is the highest amount earned by any player in snooker history. A prolific break-builder, O'Sullivan is the only player to have reached 1,000 career century breaks. He has also achieved the highest number of officially recognized maximum breaks in professional competition (15), and the fastest competitive maximum break, compiled in a time of 5 minutes and 8 seconds at the 1997 World Championship. He first became world number one in the 2002/2003 season and held the position for five out of eight seasons, ending in May 2010. He regained the top ranking in March 2019 after a nine-year absence, the longest time any player has spent between spells as world number one, and held it until August 2019. O'Sullivan has often been a controversial figure in the sport.

The award is given to the performers, producers, audio engineers and mastering engineer for new songs in Spanish or Portuguese language. The songs included on an album released the previous year of submission are also eligible only if they have not been submitted to competition before. Instrumental songs are also eligible. Due to the increasing musical changes in the industry, from 2012 the category includes 10 nominees, according to a restructuration made by the academy for the four general categories: Song of the Year, Album of the Year, Best New Artist and Record of the Year. 14 of the eighteen awarded songs have also earned the Latin Grammy for Song of the Year, which unlike this category, is given to the songwriters. The exceptions to this were in 2000, 2009, 2013 and 2014 when Dímelo by Marc Anthony, Aquí Estoy Yo by Luis Fonsi featuring David Bisbal, Noel Schajris and Aleks Syntek, Volví a Nacer by Carlos Vives, and Bailando by Enrique Iglesias featuring Descemer Bueno and Gente De Zona, respectively, received the Song of the Year award without earning Record of the Year. Alejandro Sanz has won the most awards in the category with six wins out of eleven nominations, including the award received for La Tortura, his collaboration with Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira. Sanz is followed by Calle 13, Jorge Drexler, Juanes and Shakira with two winning songs. Livin' la Vida Loca by Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin is the only song to be nominated for this award in its Spanish-language version and to receive the same distinction for the English language version at the 42nd Grammy Awards. Most nominated songs were recorded in Spanish language, though Esperando Na Janela by Gilberto Gil, Ja Sei Namorar by Tribalistas, A Festa by Maria Rita, Dois Rios by Skank, Arlequim Desconhecido by Ivan Lins and The Metropole Orchestra, Tua by Maria Bethânia, Atrás de Porta by Ivete Sangalo, Um Abraçaço by Caetano Veloso, Vidas Pra Contar by Djavan, and É Fake (Homem Barato) by Anaadi, recorded in Portuguese language, were also nominated. In 2017, Colombian artist Maluma became the first performer to have three nominated songs in the same year. passages: MTV Unplugged (Alejandro Sanz album): MTV Unplugged is the second live album from Spanish singer-songwriter Alejandro Sanz , which turns him into the first Spanish artist in recording an unplugged for MTV , and in this opportunity he resorts to Humberto Gatica 's talent as producer and arranger . | ", "label": "Manuela"}

Its operator is the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York. Serving 301,763 passengers per day as of 2007 and 88.5 million riders for the year of 2008, it is the busiest commuter railroad in the United States. With 324 passenger route-miles, it spans Long Island from Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn to Montauk station at the tip of the southern fork. Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan is the actual westernmost station of the Long Island Rail Road and its busiest station. The system currently has 124 stations on eleven rail lines called branches. (Not included in this count are two additional stations that serve employees of the LIRR: Hillside Facility and Boland's Landing). Two stations are open seasonally: Belmont Park and Mets-Willets Point; in addition, the Pinelawn station exclusively serves cemeteries in its area and is thus served during daytime hours. Hunterspoint Avenue and Long Island City are open only on weekdays. The six stations on the Main Line east of Ronkonkoma get a few weekday-only trains. Jamaica is a major transfer station between branches, as it provides the interchange from the eastern Long Island stations to the western New York terminals and vice versa. Other inter-branch transfer stations include Woodside, Mineola, Hicksville, Valley Stream, Lynbrook and Babylon. passages: Belmont Park Branch: Belmont Park is a seasonal-use Long Island Rail Road station on the grounds of the Belmont Park racetrack in Elmont , New York . | Belmont Park station: Belmont Park is a seasonal-use Long Island Rail Road station on the grounds of the Belmont Park racetrack in Elmont , New York . | ", "label": "the grounds of the Belmont Park racetrack"}

It includes notable churches either where a church means a congregation (in the New Testament definition) or where a church means a building (in the colloquial sense). It also includes campgrounds and conference centers and retreats that are significant Methodist gathering places, including a number of historic sites of camp meetings. This very limited list includes only historically or architecturally significant buildings, and omits many of the currently very largest and influential congregations which do not meet that standard. Methodism was founded with a large component being a rejection of past churches and was developed by John Wesley and others in large open-air gatherings in Great Britain. In the United States, Methodists (along with Baptists and other Protestants) were major participants in the Second Great Awakening wherein people would travel from a large area to a particular site to camp out, listen to itinerant preachers, and pray. The list also includes selected notable Methodist theological buildings. In the United States, numerous Methodist churches are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and on state and local historic registers, many reflecting the values of plainness, of Gothic architecture, of simple adornment. The Greek Revival style is also simple and came to be adopted for numerous American Methodist churches. passages: ", "label": "2"}

The United States shares a 2,000 mi ( 3,000 km ) border with Mexico . It is the most frequently crossed international border in the world , with about 250 million legal crossings every year . [ 3 ] The distribution of the population in Mexico , especially , in urban areas , has been changed significantly by the economic interaction between settlements in its north and the United States . The increasing population concentration in the north of Mexico is strongly associated with the development of the maquila industries there and the eventual economic effects of North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) . [ 5 ] Metropolitan areas at the border with the US form transnational conurbations with deep economic and demographic interaction . For example , the San Diego – Tijuana metropolitan area consists of San Diego County in the US and the municipalities of Tijuana , Playas de Rosarito , and Tecate in Mexico . The total population of the region has been estimated to be just over 5 million in 2009 , making it by far the largest binational metropolitan area shared between the US and Mexico . [ 6 ] The National Population Council ( CONAPO ) recognizes the existence of such metropolitan areas and defines them as the municipalities with a city of at least 200,000 inhabitants and sharing processes of conurbation with cities of the US : [ 1 ] | The metropolitan areas of Mexico have bean traditionally defined as the group of municipalities that heavily interact with each other, usually around a core city. passages: Laredo-Nuevo Laredo Metropolitan Area: This metropolitan area is also known as the Two Laredos or the Laredo Borderplex .

This subgenre is a collection of graphically violent movies that usually depict cannibalism by primitive, Stone-age natives deep within the Asian or South American rainforests. While cannibalism is the uniting feature of these films, the general emphasis focuses on various forms of shocking, realistic and graphic violence, typically including torture, rape and genuine cruelty to animals. This subject matter was often used as the main advertising draw of cannibal films in combination with exaggerated or sensational claims regarding the films' reputations. The genre evolved in the early 1970s from a similar subgenre known as Mondo films, exploitation documentaries which claimed to present genuine taboo behaviors from around the world. Umberto Lenzi is often cited as originating the cannibal genre with his 1972 film Man from Deep River, while Antonio Climati's Natura contro from 1988 is similarly regarded to have brought the trend to a close. Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust, released in 1980, is often considered to be the most well-known film of the genre due to the significant controversy surrounding its release, and is one of the few films of the genre to garner mainstream attention. In recent years, the genre has experienced a cult following and revival, as new productions influenced by the original wave of films have been released. Due to their graphic content, the films of this subgenre are often the center of controversy, and many have been censored or banned in countries around the world. The animal cruelty featured in many of the films is often the focal point of the controversy, and these scenes have been targeted by certain countries' film boards. Several cannibal films also appeared on the video nasty list released by the Director of Public Prosecutions in 1983 in the United Kingdom. Nonetheless, the genre has occasionally fallen under critical interpretation, and certain films have been noted for containing themes of anti-imperialism and third world oppression. passages: Tsui Hark: Tsui Hark ( Chinese : 徐克 , Vietnamese : Từ Khắc , born 15 February 1950 ) , born Tsui Man-kong , is a Hong Kong film director , producer and screenwriter . | ", "label": "1950"}

Reservations and reserves | Location of Sioux tribes prior to 1770 ( dark green ) and their current reservations ( orange ) in the US In the late 19th century , railroads wanted to build tracks through Indian lands . The railroad companies hired hunters to exterminate the bison herds , the Plains Indians ' primary food supply . The Dakota and Lakota were forced to accept US-defined reservations in exchange for the rest of their lands and farming and ranching of domestic cattle , as opposed to a nomadic , hunting economy . During the first years of the Reservation Era , the Sioux people depended upon annual federal payments guaranteed by treaty for survival . In Minnesota , the treaties of Traverse des Sioux and Mendota in 1851 left the Dakota with a reservation 20 miles ( 32 km ) wide on each side of the Minnesota River . Today , half of all enrolled Sioux in the United States live off reservation . Enrolled members in any of the Sioux tribes in the United States are required to have ancestry that is at least 1/4 degree Sioux ( the equivalent to one grandparent ) . [ 78 ] In Canada , the Canadian government recognizes the tribal community as First Nations . The land holdings of these First Nations are called Indian reserves . | The Sioux (/suː/; Dakota: Očhéthi Šakówiŋ /otʃʰeːtʰi ʃakoːwĩ/) are groups of Native American tribes and First Nations peoples in North America. The term is an exonym created from a French transcription of the Anishinaabe term Nadouessioux, and can refer to any ethnic group within the Great Sioux Nation or to any of the nation's many language dialects. The modern Sioux consist of two major divisions based on language divisions: the Dakota and Lakota. Before the 17th century, the Santee Dakota (Isáŋyathi; Knife also known as the Eastern Dakota) lived around Lake Superior with territories in present-day northern Minnesota and Wisconsin. They gathered wild rice, hunted woodland animals and used canoes to fish. Wars with the Ojibwe throughout the 1700s pushed the Dakota into southern Minnesota, where the Western Dakota (Yankton, Yanktonai) and Teton (Lakota) were residing. In the 1800s, the Dakota signed treaties with the United States, ceding much of their land in Minnesota. Failure of the United States to make treaty payments on time, as well as low food supplies, led to the Dakota War of 1862, which resulted in the Dakota being exiled from Minnesota to numerous reservations in Nebraska, North and South Dakota and Canada. After 1870, the Dakota people began to return to Minnesota, creating the present-day reservations in the state. The Yankton and Yanktonai Dakota (Iháŋktȟuŋwaŋ and Iháŋktȟuŋwaŋna; Village-at-the-end and Little village-at-the-end), collectively also referred to by the endonym Wičhíyena, resided in the Minnesota River area before ceding their land and moving to South Dakota in 1858. Despite ceding their lands, their treaty with the U.S. government allowed them to maintain their traditional role in the Očhéthi Šakówiŋ as the caretakers of the Pipestone Quarry, which is the cultural center of the Sioux people. They are considered to be the Western Dakota (also called middle Sioux), and have in the past been erroneously classified as Nakota. passages: South Dakota: As the southern part of the former Dakota Territory , South Dakota became a state on November 2 , 1889 , simultaneously with North Dakota .

It has borders with the Black Sea to the southeast, Bulgaria to the south, Ukraine to the north, Hungary to the west, Serbia to the southwest, and Moldova to the east. It has a predominantly temperate-continental climate. With a total area of 238,397 square kilometers (92,046 square miles), Romania is the 8th largest country and also the 6th most populous member state of the European Union, having almost 20 million inhabitants. Its capital and largest city is Bucharest, and other major urban areas include Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara, Iași, Constanța, Craiova, Brașov, and Galați. The River Danube, Europe's second-longest river, rises in Germany's Black Forest and flows in a general southeast direction for 2,857 km (1,775 mi), coursing through ten countries before emptying into Romania's Danube Delta. The Carpathian Mountains, which cross Romania from the north to the southwest, include Moldoveanu Peak, at an altitude of 2,544 m (8,346 ft). Modern Romania was formed in 1859 through a personal union of the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia. The new state, officially named Romania since 1866, gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877. Following World War I after declaring its neutrality in 1914, when Romania fought on the side of the Allied powers starting with 1916, Bukovina, Bessarabia, Transylvania as well as parts of Banat, Crișana, and Maramureș became part of the sovereign Kingdom of Romania. In June-August 1940, as a consequence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and Second Vienna Award, Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union, and Northern Transylvania to Hungary. In November 1940, Romania signed the Tripartite Pact and, consequently, in June 1941 entered World War II on the Axis side, fighting against the Soviet Union until August 1944, when it joined the Allies and recovered Northern Transylvania. passages: Sud - Muntenia (development region): As other development regions , it does not have any administrative powers , its main function being to co-ordinate regional development projects and manage funds from the European Union . | ", "label": "Călărași"}

The Western Australian education system traditionally consists of primary schools, which accommodate students from kindergarten to Year 6, and high schools, which accommodate students from Years 7 to 12. Previously primary schools accounted for Year 7 education, but in 2015 all Western Australian schools transitioned Year 7 to be a part of the high school system. In country areas, district high schools serve as both primary and junior high schools, with students generally commuting to or boarding at larger towns to finish the last two years of their education. passages: City of Kalamunda: The city covers an area of 324.2 square kilometres ( 125.2 sq mi ) , much of which is state forest rising into the Darling Scarp to the east . | ", "label": "57,449 people"}

The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. Due to the nature of this medal, it is commonly presented posthumously. Sixty men of Hispanic heritage have been awarded the Medal of Honor. Of the sixty Medals of Honor presented to Hispanics, two were presented to members of the United States Navy, thirteen to members of the United States Marine Corps and forty-six to members of the United States Army. Forty-two Medals of Honor were presented posthumously. The first recipient was Corporal Joseph H. De Castro of the Union Army for his actions at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania on July 3, 1863, during the American Civil War and the most recent recipient is Sergeant First Class Leroy Petry for his actions in Afghanistan. Corporal De Castro was a member of the Massachusetts Infantry, a militia that was not part of the regular army; however, Private David Bennes Barkley was a member of the regular army during World War I and has been recognized as the Army's first Hispanic Medal of Honor recipient. In 1864, Seaman John Ortega became the first Hispanic member of the U.S. Navy to receive the Medal of Honor and in 1900, Private France Silva became the first person of Hispanic descent in the U.S. Marine Corps to receive the medal. President Barack Obama awarded the Medal of Honor to 17 Hispanics on a March 18, 2014 in a ceremony in the White House. The award comes through the National Defense Authorization Act which called for a review of Jewish American and Hispanic American veterans from WWII, the Korean War and the Vietnam War to ensure that no prejudice was shown to those deserving the Medal of Honor. Fifteen recipients were born outside the United States mainland, one each in Chile and Spain, five in Mexico and eight in Puerto Rico. passages: 101st Airborne Division: The titles reflect the division 's shift from airplanes to helicopters as the primary method of delivering troops into combat . | ", "label": "US Army Air Assault School"}

Until 1991, the Billboard album chart was based on a survey of representative retail outlets that determined a ranking, not a tally of actual sales. Weekly surveys and year-end charts by Billboard and other publications such as now defunct Cash Box magazine sometimes differed. For instance, during the 1960s and 1970s, the number-one album as determined by these two publications differed in 10 out of 20 years. From 1992 onwards, the Billboard year-end and weekly charts were calculated by Nielsen SoundScan.

(Chinese: 熊貓軟體公司; pinyin: Xióngmāo Ruǎntǐ Gōngsī), was a video game developer from Taiwan that was active during the 1990s. They developed games for MS-DOS and for the Taiwanese only game console Super A'Can, made by Funtech. Their most famous game is Sango Fighter, and their highest selling game was Crazy Dodgeball. [citation needed] Some of their games became notorious for the usage of Adolf Hitler as a playable character, including the African Adventures series and Hilarious Bowling. In 2009 North American company Super Fighter Team acquired the full legal rights to some of the company's games, re-releasing Sango Fighter as freeware immediately afterward. In 2012, Super Fighter Team acquired the remainder of Panda's games. passages: ", "label": "2"}

According to the 2012 Census estimates, the three metropolitan areas with the largest Chinese-American populations were the Greater New York Combined Statistical Area at 735,019 people, the San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland Combined Statistical Area at 629,243 people, and the Greater Los Angeles Combined Statistical Area at about 566,968 people. In the post-1965 era, first- and second-generation immigrants include those from Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Also included in the Chinese-American population enumeration are ethnic Chinese from Malaysia and Vietnam who might identify themselves as Chinese, thus skewing the census reporting. New York City is home to by far the highest Chinese-American population of any city proper, with an estimated 573,388 Chinese-Americans in New York City, significantly higher than the total of the next five cities combined; multiple large Chinatowns in Manhattan, Brooklyn (three), and Queens (three) are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves, as large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York, with the largest metropolitan Chinese population outside Asia. The Los Angeles County city of Monterey Park has the highest percentage of Chinese-Americans of any municipality, at 43.7% of its population, or 24,758 people. The San Gabriel Valley region of Los Angeles County is the single largest concentration of combined Chinese and Taiwanese Americans in the country, having a collections of U.S. suburbs with large foreign-born Chinese-speaking populations, ranging from working-class individuals residing in Rosemead and El Monte to wealthier immigrants living in Arcadia, San Marino, and Diamond Bar. A similar demographic shift has also taken place in the southern half of the San Francisco Bay Area. Conversely, the suburbs of New York City within the state of New Jersey are notable for their widespread and increasing prevalence of Chinese-Americans (see list below), reflecting their general affluence and propensity for professional occupations. passages: ", "label": "1.1"}

As a group, the two events are referred to as the horizontal jumps. The competitor runs down the track and performs a hop, a bound and then a jump into the sand pit. The triple jump was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games and has been a modern Olympics event since the Games' inception in 1896. According to IAAF rules, the hop shall be made so that an athlete lands first on the same foot\nas that from which he has taken off; in the step he shall land on the\nother foot, from which, subsequently, the jump is performed.

The remaining routes are spurs off the main Pond Eddy–Monticello route . Route list | County routes in Sullivan County, New York, are maintained by the Sullivan County highway department and signed with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices-standard yellow-on-blue pentagon route marker. The county highway system comprises roughly 140 routes arranged across the county in groups of nine. For the most part, state routes in Sullivan County are county-maintained and co-signed with county routes. However, the converse is not true; that is, not all county routes overlap state routes for their entire length. Typically, each series consists of county routes along a single roadway, often overlapping with state highways in the process. The lowest numbered route in the system is County Route 11 (CR 11); the highest is CR 183C. Note that routes 160 through 169 do not conform to any style, and coincidentally the 170 through 179 series (with the exception of the spur designated 174A) follows the pre-expressway routing of New York State Route 17 (NY 17).

Use of pre-nominal styles and post-nominal initials. An honorary award is one made to a person who is not a citizen of a Commonwealth realm. He or she cannot use the pre-nominal style of 'Sir' or 'Dame', but can use the post-nominal letters (after their names), subject to the prevailing conventions in his or her own country. If such a person later acquires citizenship of a Commonwealth realm, then any honorary awards usually become substantive, and in the case of knights and dames they can begin to use the pre-nominal styles. However this is not automatic. The person must be dubbed by the Queen or Her Majesty's delegate in order to be entitled to use the pre-nominal style.

In 1971, it became part of the Eclipse Awards program as the award for Champion Older Female Horse. In 1936 both the Turf & Sports Digest magazine and Daily Racing Form (DRF) began naming an annual champion. Starting in 1950, the Thoroughbred Racing Associations (TRA) began naming its own champion. The following list provides the name of the horses chosen by both of these organizations. Whenever there were different champions named, the horses are listed side-by-side with the one chosen as champion by the Daily Racing Form noted with the letters (DRF), the one chosen by the Thoroughbred Racing Associations by the letters (TRA) and the one chosen by Turf and Sports Digest by the letters (TSD). Prior to 1971 this award was referred to as Champion Female Handicap Horse or Champion Handicap Mare. The Daily Racing Form version was open to any female horse, and was given to some Champions at the age of three, such as Tosmah, Twilight Tear and Busher. Champions from 1887 through 1935 were selected retrospectively by a panel of experts as published by The Blood-Horse magazine. In 2015, the Daily Racing Form, the Thoroughbred Racing Associations, and the National Turf Writers Association decided that the award would be renamed and awarded to older female horses proficient in dirt and main track races. passages: Bewitch (horse): Before the end of her first season , Ben Jones turned her training over to his son , Jimmy Jones , who also became a member of the Hall of Fame .

Zoë Ball returned as presenter of Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two on BBC Two. Len Goodman, Bruno Tonioli, Craig Revel Horwood and Darcey Bussell also returned as judges. This was the first series to be made at Elstree Film and Television Studios in Elstree, Hertfordshire. In March 2013, the show's former home at the BBC Television Centre in West London closed down for redevelopment. Strictly moved to Elstree for this series and settled into the vast George Lucas Stage 2 which had been recently refurbished. The move to the Elstree location saw a complete overhaul of the look of the show, with a newly redesigned set, which would fit the much larger George Lucas Stage. The shows on 5 October, 9 November and 7 December 2013 were hosted by Daly and Winkleman, with Forsyth taking time off. The show was broadcast live from Blackpool Tower Ballroom on 16 November 2013. The series was won by Abbey Clancy and Aljaž Skorjanec on 21 December 2013. This series was notable as being Forsyth's last as main presenter and also for Brendan Cole becoming the first professional dancer to reach three separate finals. passages: Rachel Riley: A mathematics graduate , her television debut came when she joined Countdown aged 22 .

The ethnolinguistic groups include various Afroasiatic, Khoisan, Niger-Congo and Nilo-Saharan populations. The official population count of the various ethnic groups in Africa is highly uncertain, both due to limited infrastructure to perform censuses and due to the rapid population growth. There have also been accusations of deliberate misreporting in order to give selected ethnicities numerical superiority (as in the case of Nigeria's Hausa, Fulani, Yoruba and Igbo people). A 2009 genetic clustering study, which genotyped 1327 polymorphic markers in various African populations, identified six ancestral clusters. The clustering corresponded closely with ethnicity, culture and language. A 2018 whole genome sequencing study of the world's populations observed similar clusters among the populations in Africa. At K=9, distinct ancestral components defined the Afrosiatic-speaking populations inhabiting North Africa and Northeast Africa; the Nilo-Saharan-speaking populations in Northeast Africa and East Africa; the Ari populations in Northeast Africa; the Niger-Congo-speaking populations in West-Central Africa, West Africa, East Africa and Southern Africa; the Pygmy populations in Central Africa; and the Khoisan populations in Southern Africa. passages: Namibia: Namibia ( /nəˈmɪbiə/ ( listen ) , /næˈ-/ ) , officially the Republic of Namibia , is a country in Southern Africa .

It includes notable churches either where a church means a congregation (in the New Testament definition) or where a church means a building (in the colloquial sense). It also includes campgrounds and conference centers and retreats that are significant Methodist gathering places, including a number of historic sites of camp meetings. This very limited list includes only historically or architecturally significant buildings, and omits many of the currently very largest and influential congregations which do not meet that standard. Methodism was founded with a large component being a rejection of past churches and was developed by John Wesley and others in large open-air gatherings in Great Britain. In the United States, Methodists (along with Baptists and other Protestants) were major participants in the Second Great Awakening wherein people would travel from a large area to a particular site to camp out, listen to itinerant preachers, and pray. The list also includes selected notable Methodist theological buildings. In the United States, numerous Methodist churches are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and on state and local historic registers, many reflecting the values of plainness, of Gothic architecture, of simple adornment. The Greek Revival style is also simple and came to be adopted for numerous American Methodist churches. passages: ", "label": "Methodist Episcopal Church of Port Hadlock"}

It includes notable churches either where a church means a congregation (in the New Testament definition) or where a church means a building (in the colloquial sense). It also includes campgrounds and conference centers and retreats that are significant Methodist gathering places, including a number of historic sites of camp meetings. This very limited list includes only historically or architecturally significant buildings, and omits many of the currently very largest and influential congregations which do not meet that standard. Methodism was founded with a large component being a rejection of past churches and was developed by John Wesley and others in large open-air gatherings in Great Britain. In the United States, Methodists (along with Baptists and other Protestants) were major participants in the Second Great Awakening wherein people would travel from a large area to a particular site to camp out, listen to itinerant preachers, and pray. The list also includes selected notable Methodist theological buildings. In the United States, numerous Methodist churches are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and on state and local historic registers, many reflecting the values of plainness, of Gothic architecture, of simple adornment. The Greek Revival style is also simple and came to be adopted for numerous American Methodist churches. passages: ", "label": "First Methodist Episcopal church"}

Race start time : 7:30:04 AM Men | The 2011 Chicago Marathon was the 34th edition of the annual marathon race in Chicago, Illinois which was held on Sunday, October 9. The men's race was won by Kenya's Moses Mosop in a time of 2:05:38 hours - a course record. Ejegayehu Dibaba, making her marathon distance debut, was the women's winner in 2:22:09. Some 37,400 runners started the event (a new high for the Chicago race) and the final total of 35,670 finishers was the second highest in its history. The pre-event favorite for the men's competition was Moses Mosop, who had run 2:03:06 for second place at the 2011 Boston Marathon and had broken two track world records at the Prefontaine Classic in July. His principal challengers were Bekana Daba, Ryan Hall, Bernard Kipyego, and the 2008 Chicago winner Evans Cheruiyot. Inconsistent pace-making for the first half of the race reduced the chances of fast times for the elite men. A large number of runners remained at the half-way point, which was reached in just under 63 minutes. The leading pack was reduced to five at the 30 km mark with Ethiopia's Bekana Daba the sole non-Kenyan alongside Wesley Korir, Mosop, Kipyego and Cheruiyot. Mosop pulled away and increased his lead over the final 12 km to win in a course record time of 2:05:38 hours (four seconds faster than the late Samuel Wanjiru's time from 2009). Korir finished quickly to cross the line after 2:06:15 hours and Kipyego soon followed to complete the sixth Kenyan podium sweep of the race's history.

Despite the large number of speakers of these languages, only Maithili has been constitutionally recognised in India, which gained constitutional status via the 92nd amendment to the Constitution of India, of 2003 (gaining assent in 2004). Both Maithili and Bhojpuri have constitutional recognition in Nepal. In Bihar, Hindi is the language used for educational and official matters. These languages were legally absorbed under the overarching label Hindi in the 1961 Census. Such state and national politics are creating conditions for language endangerments. After independence Hindi was given the sole official status through the Bihar Official Language Act, 1950. Hindi was displaced as the sole official language of Bihar in 1981, when Urdu was accorded the status of the second official language. [citation needed] passages: ", "label": "39,519,400"}

The team, largely formed from the Great Britain team which also represented Wales, Scotland and Ireland, is run under the auspices of the Rugby Football League. It participates in the Rugby League World Cup, Four Nations and Test matches. The team dates to 1904, when they played against a mixture of Welsh and Scottish players in Wigan. Until the 1950s, they regularly toured Australia and New Zealand and played both home and away matches against neighbours Wales and France, but when it was decided that Great Britain would tour the Southern Hemisphere instead of England, France and Wales became the only regular opponents. Their first appearance in the Rugby League World Cup was in 1975. They have been three times runners-up; in 1975, 1995 and 2017. England also competed in the European Nations Cup, and, in 2006, an England 'A' team competed for the Federation Shield. England's main rivals historically were Wales and France, with the rivalries stretching back to 1908 and 1934 respectively. England's main rivals now are Australia and New Zealand. Traditionally a predominantly white kit is worn including white shorts and socks. However the jersey usually features some form of red, like red stripes, crosses or chevrons. passages: ", "label": "171"}

It was originally built by the BBC, entering service in October 1956 acting as a main transmitter for BBC Band II VHF FM radio. It had been planned that the BBC's 405-line VHF television service would commence on the same date, but delays at Rowridge caused the official switch-on to happen six months later on 29 April 1957. Blaenplwyf was considered a main transmitter for VHF television (despite radiating only 3 kW ERP) as it was fed from a microwave link from Mynydd Pencarreg just south of Lampeter. The facility is now owned and operated by Arqiva. The site has a 152 metres (499 ft) guyed steel lattice mast standing on land that is itself 175 metres (574 ft) above sea level. The television and radio broadcasts were originally designed to cover the majority of the Cardigan Bay coastline, the antennas being designed for maximum ERP to the north and to the south-west. Blaenplwyf became a main transmitter for UHF analogue colour television from 1970 onwards, and was transmitting all three original UHF channels in colour from mid 1973. It currently carries all six UK digital television multiplexes. passages: ", "label": "Pal"}

[ 14 ] * Season shortened by the 1994–95 NHL lockout | The Roger Crozier Saving Grace Award, officially billed as the MBNA/MasterCard Roger Crozier Saving Grace Award, was an award in ice hockey given annually to the goaltender who finished the regular season with the best save percentage in the National Hockey League (NHL). Only goaltenders who played 25 games or more in the season were eligible for the award. A goaltender's save percentage represents the percentage of shots on goal that he stops, and is calculated by dividing the number of saves by the total number of shots on goal. The award was first presented at the conclusion of the 1999-2000 season, and was named in honor of former Detroit Red Wings, Buffalo Sabres and Washington Capitals goaltender Roger Crozier, a Calder and Conn Smythe Trophy winner who played in the NHL from 1964 to 1977. It was presented by the MBNA corporation in memory of Crozier, who worked for the MBNA America Bank after retiring as a player, and died on January 11, 1996. The winner of the trophy received a commemorative crystal trophy and was given US$25,000 to donate to a youth hockey or other educational program of their choice. By 2007, when it ceased being presented, the award had been handed to six different players on seven occasions. Marty Turco is the only goaltender to have won the award twice. Three Dallas Stars goalies have won the award, while two each have represented the Montreal Canadiens and the Minnesota Wild. Only seven awards were ever made. The award was not presented in 2005, as the entire 2004-05 season was canceled due to the lockout. passages: Montreal Canadiens: They compete in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference .

It is on a meander of the River Thames, with a large number of parks and open spaces, including Richmond Park, and many protected conservation areas, which include much of Richmond Hill. A specific Act of Parliament protects the scenic view of the River Thames from Richmond. Richmond was founded following Henry VII's building of Richmond Palace in the 16th century, from which the town derives its name. (The palace itself was named after Henry's earldom of Richmond, North Yorkshire.) During this era the town and palace were particularly associated with Elizabeth I, who spent her last days there. During the 18th century Richmond Bridge was completed and many Georgian terraces were built, particularly around Richmond Green and on Richmond Hill. These remain well preserved and many have listed building architectural or heritage status. The opening of the railway station in 1846 was a significant event in the absorption of the town into a rapidly expanding London. Richmond was formerly part of the ancient parish of Kingston upon Thames in the county of Surrey. In 1890 the town became a municipal borough, which was later extended to include Kew, Ham, Petersham and part of Mortlake (North Sheen). The municipal borough was abolished in 1965 when, as a result of local government reorganisation, Richmond was transferred from Surrey to Greater London. passages: ", "label": "Kew Road , Richmond TW9 2TN"}

Tian was born to an influential actor and actress in China. Following a short stint in the military, Tian began his artistic career first as an amateur photographer and then as an assistant cinematographer at the Beijing Agricultural Film Studio. In 1978, he was accepted to the Beijing Film Academy, from which he graduated in 1982, together with classmates Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou. The class of 1982 collectively would soon gain fame as the so-called Fifth Generation film movement, with Tian Zhuangzhuang as one of the movement's key figures. Tian's early career was marked both with avant-garde documentary infused films (On the Hunting Ground (1985), The Horse Thief (1986)) to more commercial fare (Li Lianying: The Imperial Eunuch (1991)). In 1991, Tian began work on a quiet epic about one of modern China's darkest moments. This film, The Blue Kite (1993), would eventually result in Tian's nearly decade long exile from the film industry, an exile he returned from with Springtime in a Small Town (2001). Throughout the 2000s, Tian Zhuangzhuang returned to the fore of Chinese cinema, directing films like the biopic The Go Master (2006) and the historical action film The Warrior and the Wolf (2009). Since his banning after the release of The Blue Kite, Tian has also emerged as a mentor for some of China's newest film talents, and he has helped produce several important films for these new generations of directors. passages: So Close to Paradise: The film was a coproduction of the Beijing Film Studio , and Beijing Jin Die Yingshi Yishu , as such , it is Wang 's first major film production within the Chinese studio system .

In more modern times the fixture list has been standardised at 26 games per team . As a result of this fairly lengthy schedule , it has been almost impossible for British rugby league teams to lose all their games , with the only exception being during World War II 's so-called `` Wartime emergency League '' when teams were often able to arrange no more than ten games and some as few as five . The only four winless seasons since normal competition resumed after the war have been in the second and third divisions of the Championship . In 2018 , West Wales Raiders set a number of Rugby League records for futility on course to losing all 26 games , including the largest point differential ( -1930 points ) , most points conceded ( 2106 ) and largest average number of points conceded per game ( 81 ) . In addition , they were on the receiving end of Rugby League 's largest ever defeat - a 144-0 loss to York City Knights . | A winless season is a regular season in which a sports team fails to win any of its games. The antithesis of a perfect season, this ignominy has been suffered twelve times in professional American football, six times in arena football, three times in professional Canadian football, once each in American professional lacrosse and box lacrosse, more than twenty-five times in major Australian football leagues, over twenty times in top-level rugby league, at least twice in top-level rugby union, and twice in English county cricket. passages: Broughton Rangers: The original club folded in 1955 . | ", "label": "Stefan Hopewell"}

Born in Dannevirke circa 2008, he is named after All Black Sonny Bill Williams. He become famous after his feeding behaviour was used to correctly predict the winner of each of the New Zealand national rugby union team's matches at the 2011 Rugby World Cup. His role at the 2011 Rugby World Cup has been compared to that of Paul the Octopus at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Sonny Wools owner is Beverley Dowling. His agent is Dan Boyd, who also designed the sheeps prediction process. The prediction process was designed so that Sonny Wool was presented with two boxes containing feed in the form of hay, each box marked on the outside with the flag of a national rugby union team in a forthcoming match. His choice of which hay to eat first was interpreted as indicating his prediction of a win for the country whose flag was on that box. Selections by the sheep have been correct in all of New Zealands matches in the 2011 Rugby World Cup, though predictions for the other three quarter-finals turned out to be incorrect. Sonny Wool has his own website, Facebook and Twitter accounts. He was reported to be under 24-hour security watch after receiving death threats. passages: ", "label": "76 points"}

Its focus is on global pop and independent music from artists of Spanish, Caribbean, and Latin American origin or background. It was notable for its eclectic and idiosyncratic English-language coverage of mostly Spanish-language music. It was praised as the Pitchfork of Latin Music and as hands down the best go-to music site for indie music out of America and Spain. Club Fonograma was created in Phoenix, Arizona in 2008 by Carlos Reyes, while attending college in Phoenix. During its run, the site has expanded from a simple music review site and now also covers events such as South by Southwest, the Latin American Music Conference, Vive Latino, and Festival NRMAL. Their coverage has also been praised by American music outlets such as Pitchfork and NPR. The site also won a 2012 IMAS award for Best Music Website. From 2008 through 2011, the site curated a mixtape series called Fonogramaticos. These albums contained a mix of unreleased songs from both prominent major-label acts and unsigned or independent artists, and are free for readers to download. A total of fourteen volumes were created in the series. Since then, the site has released annual compilations outside the Fonogramaticos series. passages: Bueninvento: Bueninvento ( Goodinvention ) is an album released by Mexican singer-songwriter and instrumentalist Julieta Venegas in 2000 . | ", "label": "Julieta Venegas"}

Founded on January 9, 1914 on the campus of Howard University in Washington, D.C., Phi Beta Sigma has opened chapters at other colleges, universities, and cities, and named them with Greek-letters. The fraternity's expansion started with its second (Beta) and third (Gamma) chapters, chartered at Wiley College and Morgan State College respectively in 1915. Today, the fraternity serves through a membership of more than 200,000 men in over 700 chapters in the United States, Europe, Asia, and the Caribbean. The fraternity has reserved the designation Omega chapter as a memorial to those brothers who are deceased.

The winner is voted on by 30 members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Each submits a vote for first, second, and third place among the managers of each league. [a] The manager with the highest score in each league wins the award. Several managers have won the award in a season when they led their team to 100 or more wins. Lou Piniella won 116 games with the Seattle Mariners in 2001, the most by a winning manager, and Joe Torre won 114 with the New York Yankees in 1998. Sparky Anderson and Tony La Russa finished with identical 104-58 records in 1984 and 1988, respectively. Three National League managers, including Dusty Baker, Whitey Herzog, and Larry Dierker, have exceeded the century mark as well. Baker's San Francisco Giants won 103 games in 1993; Dierker's 1998 Houston Astros won 102 and Herzog led the Cardinals to 101 wins in the award's third season. In 1991, Bobby Cox became the first manager to win the award in both leagues, winning with the Atlanta Braves and having previously won with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1985. La Russa, Piniella, Jim Leyland, Bob Melvin, Davey Johnson, and Joe Maddon have since won the award in both leagues. Cox and La Russa have won the most awards, with four. passages: 1987 Major League Baseball season: The 1987 Major League Baseball season ended with the American League Champion Minnesota Twins winning the World Series over the National League Champion St. Louis Cardinals , four games to three , as all seven games were won by the home team . | 1991 Major League Baseball season:  | Don Baylor: In 1979 , Baylor was an All-Star and won the AL Most Valuable Player Award .

It is the shortest common middle-distance running event. The 800 metres is run over two laps of the track (400-metre track) and has been an Olympic event since the first games in 1896. During indoor track season the event is usually run on a 200-metre track, therefore requiring four laps. The event was derived from the imperial measurement of a half a mile (880 yards), a traditional English racing distance. Imperial racing distances were common in the United States. American high schools (in the name of the NFHS) were the last to convert to metric distances in 1980, following the NCAA's conversion in 1976. Countries associated to the English system converted to metric distances after the 1966 Commonwealth Games. 800 m is 4.67 m less than half a mile. The event combines aerobic endurance with anaerobic conditioning and sprint speed. Both the aerobic and anaerobic systems are being taxed to a high extent, thus the 800-metre athlete is required to combine training between both systems. Runners in this event are often fast enough to compete in the 400 metres or the 4 × 400 metres relay but only Alberto Juantorena and Jarmila Kratochvílová have won major international titles at 400 m and 800 m. If they are so inclined, 400 m runners are usually encouraged to run the 200 metres while 800 m runners are encouraged to run the 1500 metres or long distance events. passages: ", "label": "1:43.61"}

The ranking was originally published from 2007-2011 by the Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan (HEEACT) and has been published since 2012 by the National Taiwan University. It uses bibliometric methods to analyze and rank the scientific paper performance. In addition to the overall ranking, it includes a list of the top universities in six fields and fourteen subjects. The rankings were introduced in 2007. The original ranking methodology favored toward universities with medical schools. In 2008, HEEACT began publishing a Field Based Ranking including six fields: agriculture and environmental sciences (AGE), clinical medicine (MED), engineering, computing, and technology (ENG), life sciences (LIFE), natural sciences (SCI), and social sciences (SOC). In 2010, HEEACT began publishing subject rankings in fields of various field of science and technology. Science fields are divided into physics, chemistry, mathematics, and geosciences. Technology fields are split up into electrical engineering, computer science, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering (including energy and fuels), materials science, and civil engineering (including environmental engineering). HEEACT ended the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities Project in 2012. Due to disagreement about ranking results, the Taiwanese education authorities announced that the government would no longer support the Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan to do this ranking. passages: US: With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world .

Kiprop broke Zersenay Tadese's winning streak which dated back to 2006, out-sprinting the defending champion in the final stages. Sammy Kitwara won the men's bronze medal and helped Kenya to the men's team title. Led by Zersenay, the Eritrean men beat Ethiopia to the team silver medal spot. Kiplagat, who was ever present at the front of the women's race, outdid Ethiopian Dire Tune in the last kilometre to win her second gold medal on the global stage. Mirroring Kitwara, Kenya's women's bronze medallist Peninah Jerop Arusei secured the team's victory over Ethiopia. Representing the hosts, Zhu Xiaolin was the only non-African to reach the top eight at the championships. The joint effort of the Japanese women aided them to a sixth consecutive team bronze medal - making them the only medalling country outside the typically strong African triumvirate of Kenya, Ethiopia and Eritrea. A total of 30 countries were represented at the 19th edition of the competition and 123 runners altogether were entered into the men's and women's races. passages: Peru: Ranging from the Norte Chico civilization starting in 3500 BC , the oldest civilization in the Americas and one of the five cradles of civilization , to the Inca Empire , the largest state in pre-Columbian America , the territory now including Peru has one of the longest histories of civilization of any country , tracing its heritage back to the 4th millennia BCE .

The sorority's chapters are organized into seven regions and further sub-divided by state. While initially Alumnae / Graduate Chapters were named using the Greek Alphabet, the perpetual body of Delta Sigma Theta voted at the Twenty-Fourth National Convention, held in Detroit, Michigan on December 26-30, 1956, to abandon this practice. Following the vote, the Greek Letter names for the Alumnae Chapters are no longer in use or recognized by the Grand Chapter. Alumnae Chapters are instead named using their Geographic Location.

Median household income divides households in a country or region into two equal segments with the first half of households earning less than the median household income and the other half earning more . It is considered by many statisticians to be a better indicator than the mean household income as it is not dramatically affected by unusually high or low values . [ 15 ] | Household income is a measure of the combined incomes of all people sharing a particular household or place of residence. It includes every form of income, e.g., salaries and wages, retirement income, near cash government transfers like food stamps, and investment gains. Average household incomes need not map directly to measures of an individual's earnings such as per capita income as numbers of people sharing households and numbers of income earners per household can vary significantly between regions and over time. Average household income can be used as an indicator for the monetary well-being of a country's citizens. Mean or median net household income, after taxes and mandatory contributions, are taken as indicators of standard of living, because they include only disposable income and acknowledge people sharing accommodation benefit from pooling at least some of their living costs. It is important to note in the tables below the difference between median and mean income. Median income is the amount that divides the income distribution into two equal groups, half having income above that amount, and half having income below that amount. Mean income (average) is the amount obtained by dividing the total aggregate income of a group by the number of units in that group. passages: United States: With an estimated population of over 328 million , the U.S. is the third most populous country in the world .

The highest threshold is `` platinum record '' and was then awarded to singles that sold over 1,000,000 units . [ 5 ] [ nb 1 ] Thirteen records were classified platinum in the 1970s and two number-one songs from the 1970s were classified as platinum in the subsequent decade .

[ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] | The UK Singles Chart is the official record chart in the United Kingdom. In the 1970s, it was compiled weekly by the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) on behalf of the British record industry with a one-week break each Christmas. Prior to 1969 many music papers compiled their own sales charts but, on 15 February 1969, the BMRB was commissioned in a joint venture by the BBC and Record Retailer to compile the chart. BMRB compiled the first chart from postal returns of sales logs from 250 record shops. The sampling cost approximately £52,000 and shops were randomly chosen and submitted figures for sales taken up to the close of trade on Saturday. The data was compiled on Monday and given to the BBC on Tuesday to be announced on Johnnie Walker's afternoon show and later published in Record Retailer (rebranded Music Week in 1972). However, the BMRB often struggled to have the full sample of sales figures returned by post. The 1971 postal strike meant that data had to be collected by telephone but this was deemed inadequate for a national chart, and by 1973 the BMRB was using motorcycle couriers to collect sales figures. In terms of number-one singles, ABBA were the most successful group of the decade having seven singles reach the top spot. The longest duration of a single at number-one was nine weeks and this was achieved on three occasions: Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen in 1975; Mull of Kintyre / Girls' School by Wings in 1977 and You're the One That I Want by John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John in 1978. Thirteen records were released that sold over one-million copies within the decade and Mull of Kintyre also became the first ever single to sell over two-million copies.

These schools are officially registered by the Minister based on formal advice from the chief executive officer of the Department of Education and Training , following an application by the governing body of the school at least six months in advance of the school 's opening . It is an offence in Western Australia to run an unregistered school , under Section 154 of the Act . Under the previous Act ( Education Act 1928 ) , a school could commence first but had to apply within one month for `` efficient '' status , which would be granted by the Minister after inspection and a comprehensive audit by the Department ( Section 32A ) . | This is a list of schools in the city of Perth, Western Australia. The Western Australian education system traditionally consists of primary schools, which accommodate students from kindergarten to Year 6, and high schools, which accommodate students from Years 7 to 12. Previously primary schools accounted for Year 7 education, but in 2015 all Western Australian schools transitioned Year 7 to be a part of the high school system. In country areas, district high schools serve as both primary and junior high schools, with students generally commuting to or boarding at larger towns to finish the last two years of their education. passages: ", "label": "Al-Hidayah Islamic School"}

The draft was held on May 20, 1974, so that the newly founded New Orleans Jazz could acquire players for the upcoming 1974-75 season. New Orleans had been awarded the expansion team on March 7, 1974. The Jazz moved to Salt Lake City in 1979 and are currently known as the Utah Jazz. In an NBA expansion draft, new NBA teams are allowed to acquire players from the previously established teams in the league. Not all players on a given team are available during an expansion draft, since each team can protect a certain number of players from being selected. In this draft, each of the seventeen other NBA teams had protected seven players from their roster and the Jazz selected seventeen unprotected players, one from each team. The Jazz were formed and owned by a group headed by Fred Rosenfeld and Sam Battistone. Former college basketball coach Scotty Robertson was hired as the franchise's first head coach and 11-time All-Star Elgin Baylor was named as one of the assistant coach. The Jazz's selections included five-time All-Star Walt Bellamy, three-time All-Star Bob Kauffman and one-time All-Star John Block. However, none of them had long careers with the Jazz; Bellamy, who was 35 years old, was waived after one game and both Kauffman and Block were traded. Prior to the draft, the Jazz made a trade with the Atlanta Hawks which brought two-time All-Star Pete Maravich to the Jazz. passages: ", "label": "F/C"}

Sixty-four NCAA Division I college baseball teams advanced to the post season tournament after having played through a regular season, and for some, a conference tournament. The 2007 tournament culminated with 8 teams advancing to the College World Series at historic Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, Nebraska, on June 15. Unseeded Oregon State repeated as national champions, winning all five of its games in the 2007 CWS. Oregon State went undefeated through the College World Series, posting a 5-0 record. The Beavers, led by head coach Pat Casey, won all three games in their four-team bracket and then defeated North Carolina in two games in the best-of-three championship series. Oregon State became the fifth team to win consecutive NCAA titles (last done by LSU in 1996-97), and were the first team to win four games in a CWS by six or more runs. As of 2019, 2007 Oregon State remains the only team to have ever won at least four games by six or more runs in the same College World Series. Their opener against Cal State Fullerton was a tight 3-2 victory, but OSU's last four games in the CWS were not close, impressive for a team seeded in the lower half of the 64-team tournament. The Beavers also became the first team to win the CWS after having posted a losing conference record. Oregon State was a disappointing 10-14 (.417) in the Pac-10, placing sixth among the nine baseball-playing schools (Oregon dropped baseball in 1981, but revived it in 2009.) However, the Beavers' non-conference record during the regular season was an impressive 28-3 (.903), and as defending NCAA champions, just enough to gain a berth in the 64-team tournament. passages: America East Conference: The America East Conference is a collegiate athletic conference affiliated with the NCAA Division I , whose members are located mainly in the Northeastern United States , specifically New England . | Atlantic Sun Conference: Northern Kentucky University ( transitioning from NCAA Division II sports to Division I ) left the conference to join the Horizon League and was replaced by the New Jersey Institute of Technology ( NJIT ) , previously the only Division I basketball independent , in 2015 .

Some anonymous works have traditionally been misattributed to better-known authors, and are now known by the name of that author, but with the prefix pseudo (meaning false in Greek), for example Pseudo-Dionysius. The other most substantial component of secondary sources for the text of the NT is its early translations into other languages, like Latin. Translations of the NT are known as versions. passages: Syriac language: Syriac originated in Mesopotamia and eventually spread west of Iraq in which it became the lingua franca of the region during the Mesopotamian Neo-Assyrian period .

Their study is the field of paleoentomology. Insects inhabited Earth since before the time of the dinosaurs. The earliest identifiable insect is the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti, estimated at 407 to 396 million years ago. Forms similar to many modern insects had already evolved before the dawning of the dinosaur and lived alongside them and beyond up to the present day. Like today, prehistoric insects were an important part of the food chain in their time. The differences between modern and prehistoric varieties can be essential, and, like many other creatures of prehistory, the latter tended to be much larger than their contemporary equivalents. This size difference is thought to be due to higher atmospheric oxygen levels (allowing diffusion through spiracles over greater distances), higher temperatures (enhancing metabolism), and the absence of birds as key predators of insect life. Since insects have chitin exoskeletons rather than mineralized bones, their burial processes differ compared to the fossils of much larger vertebrates such as dinosaurs. Many insect remains are found preserved in the hardened sap of ancient trees (amber). passages: ", "label": "Archiponera"}

It met in Washington, D.C., from March 4, 1855, to March 4, 1857, during the last two years of Franklin Pierce's presidency. The apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives was based on the Seventh Census of the United States in 1850. The Whig Party, one of the two major parties of the era, had largely collapsed, although many former Whigs ran as Republicans or as members of the Opposition Party. The Senate had a Democratic majority, and the House was controlled by a coalition of Representatives led by Nathaniel P. Banks, a member of the American Party. passages: Virginia's 1st congressional district: For years , the first district also included the other two points of the Historic Triangle-Williamsburg , the longtime capital of the colony , and Yorktown , where the decisive battle of the Revolutionary War was fought . | ", "label": "Republican Rob Wittman"}

Just three games were played: two semi finals and a final. The semi-finals were played as a double-header in Melbourne, and the final was contested a month later in Adelaide.

By this it is meant that a comprehensive list of current systematic symbols ( in the uAtom form ) are not included in the list and can instead be found in the Isotope index chart . The symbols for the named isotopes of hydrogen , deuterium ( D ) , and tritium ( T ) are still in use today , as is thoron ( Tn ) for radon-220 ( though not actinon ; An is usually used instead for a generic actinide ) . Heavy water and other deuterated solvents are commonly used in chemistry , and it is convenient to use a single character rather than a symbol with a subscript in these cases . The practice also continues with tritium compounds . When the name of the solvent is given , a lowercase d is sometimes used . For example , d6-benzene and C6D6 can be used instead of [ 2H6 ] C6H6 . [ 11 ] The symbols for isotopes of elements other than hydrogen and radon are no longer in use within the scientific community . Many of these symbols were designated during the early years of radiochemistry , and several isotopes ( namely those in the decay chains of actinium , radium , and thorium ) bear placeholder names using the early naming system devised by Ernest Rutherford . [ 12 ] | In chemistry, a symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. Symbols for chemical elements normally consist of one or two letters from the Latin alphabet and are written with the first letter capitalised. Earlier symbols for chemical elements stem from classical Latin and Greek vocabulary. For some elements, this is because the material was known in ancient times, while for others, the name is a more recent invention. For example, Pb is the symbol for lead (plumbum in Latin); Hg is the symbol for mercury (hydrargyrum in Greek); and He is the symbol for helium (a new Latin name) because helium was not known in ancient Roman times. Some symbols come from other sources, like W for tungsten (Wolfram in German) which was not known in Roman times. A 3-letter temporary symbol may be assigned to a newly synthesized (or not-yet synthesized) element. For example, Uno was the temporary symbol for hassium (element 108) which had the temporary name of unniloctium, based on its atomic number being 8 greater than 100. There are also some historical symbols that are no longer officially used. In addition to the letters for the element itself, additional details may be added to the symbol as superscripts or subscripts a particular isotope, ionization, or oxidation state, or other atomic detail. A few isotopes have their own specific symbols rather than just an isotopic detail added to their element symbol. passages: ", "label": "Deuterium"}

Buildings that have already been topped out are excluded . | The world's first skyscraper was built in Chicago in 1885. Since then, the United States has been home to some of the world's tallest skyscrapers. Eleven American buildings have held the title of tallest building in the world (9 in New York City). New York City and Chicago have always been the centers of American skyscraper building. The 10-story Home Insurance Building, built in Chicago in 1885, is regarded as the world's first skyscraper; the building was constructed using a novel steel-loadbearing frame which became a standard of the industry worldwide. Since its topping out in 2013, One World Trade Center in New York City has been the tallest skyscraper in the United States. Its spire brings the structure to a symbolic architectural height of 1,776 feet (541 m), connoting the year the U.S. Declaration of Independence was signed, though the absolute tip (or pinnacle) of the structure is measured at 1,792 ft (546 m). However, the observation deck elevation and highest occupied floor of One World Trade Center are surpassed by 432 Park Avenue and Chicago's Willis Tower (formerly and still commonly known as the Sears Tower). Steinway Tower, and Central Park Tower will also have higher occupied floors and roofs upon their completion. Prior to the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City, the twin towers of the World Trade Center occupied the second and third positions on the list below, behind Willis Tower. The North Tower stood at 1,368 feet (417 m), while the South Tower was 1,362 feet (415 m) tall. passages: Journal Squared:  | ", "label": "residential complex"}

The boys' regatta is held in mid to late March while the girls' regatta is held in late August to early September. Due to the lack of water at Wivenhoe Dam the boys' Head of the River was moved to Hinze Dam for 2006, and was then moved to Lake Kawana on the Sunshine Coast, Queensland the following year.

Her death led to a public inquiry and produced major changes in child protection policies in England\n1   2000       Murder of Sarah Payne              1       East Preston , West Sussex , England                                                              Sarah Payne , a seven-year-old girl from Surrey , was abducted and murdered by convicted child sex offender Roy Whiting in Littlehampton , West Sussex , in July 2000 . Her body was found 15 miles away just over two weeks later . Whiting was found guilty of her murder in December 2001 and sentenced to life imprisonment , with the judge saying that it was a rare case in which a life sentence should mean life . The trial judge 's recommendation was later replaced by a 50-year minimum term by the Home Office , just before politicians were stripped of their powers to decide when or if a life sentence prisoner could apply for parole . Whiting 's sentence has since been set at a 40-year minimum term by the High Court , which means that Whiting can not be considered for parole until the age of 82 . At the end of the trial , it was revealed that he already had a previous conviction for abduction and indecent assault on an eight-year-old girl in 1995 , and that he was on the sex offenders register\n2   2000   Murder of Damilola Taylor              1                           Peckham , London                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        While on his way from Peckham Library , 10-year-old Nigerian-born Damilola Taylor was found with a cut to his left thigh and bled to death within a half hour before arriving at a local hospital . Four teenagers were tried for murder in 2002 but cleared . A second trial in 2006 saw two other suspects - brothers Ricky and Gavin Preedie - found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to eight years in prison , but both were released within four years\n3   2001    Torso in the Thames case              1                      River Thames , London                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 A human torso discovered floating in the River Thames on 21 September 2001 was eventually revealed to be the remains of a recently arrived Nigerian boy , between the ages of four and seven . Although the child is thought to be a victim of a ritual killing , the London Metropolitan Police Service have yet to apprehend those responsible . The identity of the torso has never been established\n4   2001    Murder of Danielle Jones              1             East Tilbury , Essex , England                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The conviction of 15-year-old Jones ' uncle Stuart Campbell primarily relied upon forensic authorship analysis of text messages sent on the victim 's mobile phone . Jones was last seen alive on 18 June 2001 . Her body has never been found . Five months after her disappearance , police charged Campbell with murder . He was found guilty in December 2002 and sentenced to life imprisonment as well as 10 years for abduction . After the trial , controversy arose when it was revealed Campbell had prior convictions for indecent assault on other girls of similar ages . The use of forensic authorship analysis of text messages in the case provoked research into its use in other cases . Police also found bloodstained stockings , which had traces of DNA belonging to Campbell and his niece , in the loft of Campbell 's house in Essex\n5   2002     Murder of Amanda Dowler              1        Walton-on-Thames , Surrey , England  13-year-old Amanda Dowler went missing on her journey home from school . Her body was discovered six months later in Yateley , Hampshire . The investigation gained national media coverage and was the largest investigation undertaken by Surrey police . Levi Bellfield , who had been convicted of two other murders and an attempted murder ( all committed after Amanda 's disappearance ) in February 2008 , was found guilty of the murder in June 2011 and received an additional life sentence . Shortly after Bellfield 's trial , it was revealed that her mobile phone had been hacked by News of the World reporters a while after she went missing , and they had deleted text messages from her inbox , giving her parents false hope that she was still alive ( it is believed that she died the same afternoon or evening that she went missing ) . These revelations , along with numerous other phone-hacking allegations , contributed to the newspaper 's closure . Rupert Murdoch , owner of the News of the World , later awarded the Dowler family £3 million in compensation\n6   2002               Soham murders              2           Soham , Cambridgeshire , England                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Two ten-year-old girls , Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman , were murdered by local school caretaker Ian Huntley after luring them into his home on 4 August 2002 . The search for the two girls was one of the longest undertaken by British authorities . Their bodies were found two weeks after their disappearance and Huntley was jailed for life for the murders in December 2003 . In September 2005 , his minimum term was set at 40 years by the High Court , meaning that he can not be considered for parole until at least 2042 at the age of 68 . His partner , Maxine Carr , had been found guilty of perverting the course of justice and received a prison sentence of three-and-a-half years .

His real first name was revealed as Peter on the conclusion of a subsequent trial of the child 's mother 's boyfriend on a charge of raping a two-year-old . His full identity was revealed when his killers were named after the expiry of a court anonymity order on 10 August 2009 . His mother has since been released from prison . The case caused shock and concern among the public and in Parliament , partly because of the magnitude of Peter 's injuries , and because he lived in the London Borough of Haringey , under the same child care authorities that had already failed ten years earlier in the case of Victoria Climbié . This had led to a public enquiry which resulted in measures being put in place in an effort to prevent similar cases happening\n10  2007        Murder of Rhys Jones              1                        Liverpool , England                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 11-year-old Rhys Milford Jones was murdered on 22 August 2007 in Liverpool , England , when he was fatally shot in the neck .

The significant media attention around his murder ( the 17th stabbing death of a teenager in London during 2008 ) led to a series of anti-knife crime demonstrations , a raised profile for the government 's anti-knife crime maxim Operation Blunt 2 , and a review and change of UK knife crime sentencing laws . The members of the gang were later jailed for life . His sister , Brooke Kinsella , an actress whose credits include a role in EastEnders , has since been at the centre of a media campaign against knife crime\n12  2010          Murder of Tia Rigg              1                       Manchester , England                                                                                                                                               Tia Rigg was a 12-year-old girl who was murdered by her uncle , John Maden , who had an 'obsessive interest ' in pornography depicting paedophilia , rape and torture . On 3 April 2010 , Maden called Tia 's mother on the pretext of having Tia come over to his house and babysit his 10-year-old daughter . When Tia arrived at Maden 's home , he drugged her with Olanzapine , a powerful antipsychotic tranquilliser . He then inflicted a 'horrific catalogue of sexual injuries ' on Tia before stabbing her in the stomach and strangling her with a ligature made from a guitar string . Maden then dialled 999 to admit the killing ; when asked why , he said because I felt like it . Arrested and charged with rape and murder , he pleaded guilty on 4 October 2010 and was sentenced to life ; and was told that , due to the sheer depravity of his crime and the agony and terror Tia must have suffered , he should never be released\n13  2012      Murder of Daniel Pełka              1         Coventry , West Midlands , England                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Pełka , aged 4 , died of a head injury on 3 March 2012 . His mother , Magdalena Łuczak and her partner , Mariusz Krężołek , both Polish nationals , were found guilty of his murder in 2013 and jailed for life , with a minimum term of 30 years . Łuczak and Krężołek starved the child , beat him , locked him in a room , force-fed him salt and waterboarded him . He weighed only 1st 3lbs ( 7.7 kg ) - a similar weight to a baby less than a year old - when he died . A serious case review was held , as Social Services failed to act sufficiently on complaints from individuals , including staff at Daniel 's school , who were concerned that he was being deprived of food . Both Łuczak and Krężołek died in prison within three years of their conviction\n14  2012         Allenton house fire              6    Allenton , Derby , Derbyshire , England                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Allenton house fire occurred on 11 May 2012 in 18 Victory Road , a residential street in Allenton .

It was the tenth race of the 2001 Formula One World Championship and the 51st running of the event as part of the series. The 72-lap race was won by Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher after starting from second position. Ralf Schumacher finished second for the Williams team with Rubens Barrichello third in the other Ferrari. Ralf Schumacher led the opening 23 laps before he made his first pit stop and Michael Schumacher assumed the lead after the first round of pit stops. His nearest championship rival David Coulthard of the McLaren outfit served a ten-second stop-and-go penalty on lap 32 for an earlier transgression of speeding at the pit lane exit. Michael Schumacher pulled away from the slower car of Ralf Schumacher who baulked his teammate Juan Pablo Montoya, until his second pit stop on the 44th lap. Montoya led laps 46 to 50 before he ceded the lead to Michael Schumacher, who maintained it to take his fifth victory at the French Grand Prix, his sixth victory of the season and the 50th of his career. The result enabled Michael Schumacher to increase his Drivers' Championship lead over Coulthard in second to 31 points. Ralf Schumacher's second-place finish moved him past Barrichello for third. Although he retired from the event, Montoya kept fifth. Ferrari further extended their Constructors' Championship advantage to 52 points over the McLaren team in second. passages: Juan Pablo Montoya: Montoya also equals Mario Andretti and Dan Gurney by winning races in Indy cars , Formula One cars and NASCAR Cup cars . | ", "label": "Times Online 's"}

Several other former places of worship are still in existence but are no longer in religious use. The borough is on the English Channel coast and encompasses the town of Eastbourne and its suburbs. Until the late 18th century, the area was mostly farmland punctuated by four well-spread hamlets; but a fashionable seaside resort gradually developed from about 1780, based on a combination of royal patronage, a good climate, railway connections and the demands of rich visitors. Church-building rapidly followed; and although the town lacks the range of worthwhile Victorian churches found in seaside resorts such as Brighton and Bournemouth, a wide variety of architectural themes and denominations are represented. Most residents of Eastbourne identify themselves as Christian, and churches representing many Christian denominations exist in the town. The largest number of these, including the town's oldest church, belong to the Church of England, the country's officially established church. Several Nonconformist and Roman Catholic churches were founded in the 19th century, while new churches were established on housing estates such as The Hydneye and Langney as the town grew inland. There are also Jewish and Muslim places of worship. Historic England or its predecessor English Heritage have awarded listed status to several current and former church buildings in Eastbourne. A building is defined as listed when it is placed on a statutory register of buildings of special architectural or historic interest in accordance with the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, a Government department, is responsible for this; Historic England, a non-departmental public body, acts as an agency of the department to administer the process and advise the department on relevant issues. passages: ", "label": "St Gregory 's Church ( original building )"}

As of December 2017 there are a total of 133 completed and under construction buildings in Canada with an official height of 150 m (492 ft) or more. Greater Toronto has 86 (Toronto 83 (including the eight tallest buildings in Canada) Mississauga 3), Calgary has 19, Metro Vancouver has 14 (Burnaby 7, Vancouver 6, Surrey 1), Montreal has 11, Edmonton has 2, and Niagara Falls has 1. Five of Canada's ten largest cities enforce height restriction laws. In Ottawa, skyscrapers could not be built above the height of the Peace Tower until the late 1970s, when the restriction was changed so that no building could overwhelm the skyline. In Montreal, skyscrapers cannot be built above the elevation of Mount Royal. The City of Vancouver has enacted view corridors which limit the height of buildings in most areas of downtown. The City of Edmonton had an elevation restriction, approximately 150 m (492 ft) above downtown, due to the proximity of the city centre airport, until it closed in November 2013. This list does not include towers, including the CN Tower in Toronto, as they are not technically considered to be a building. passages: ", "label": "4"}

Eight AM stations and one FM station carry the `` News & Information Service '' . | Jefferson Public Radio (JPR) is a regional public radio broadcasting network serving over a million potential listeners in Southern Oregon and the Shasta Cascade region of northern California. Owned by Southern Oregon University, the network is headquartered on the SOU campus in Ashland, near Medford. It is named after the proposed State of Jefferson, an area which roughly corresponds to its vast and mostly mountainous coverage area of 60,000 square miles (160,000 km2). JPR's flagship station, KSOR in Ashland, signed on in April 1969 as a 10-watt station operated by students at what was then Southern Oregon College. It began moving away from its college radio roots during the 1970s, becoming a full NPR member by the end of the decade. In the early 1980s, it began building a massive system of translators covering large portions of Oregon and California, and now claims the largest translator network of any public radio station in the country. At first, KSOR was not familiar with the history of Jefferson. However, by the time KSOR began to build full-power satellites later in the decade, it realized that its service area was virtually coextensive with the State of Jefferson. It rebranded itself as Jefferson Public Radio in 1989, feeling that name was more than appropriate for its growing network and the area it served. passages: Grants Pass, Oregon: Grants Pass is 256 mi ( 412 km ) south of Portland , the largest city in Oregon . | ", "label": "34,533"}

No distinction has been made between enclosed courses of the type that are familiar now and those that were run over unenclosed courses , more akin to point-to-point racing . Indeed , some of these racecourses or parts of them are still used for that purpose . | This List of British racecourses gives details of both current and former horse racing venues in Great Britain. There are, as of 2 February 2020, 59 racecourses operating in Great Britain (excluding Point-to-Point courses). In addition, there is a former racecourse, Folkestone, which is mothballed pending a decision over its future. There are currently no plans for Folkestone to operate fixtures although the basic racecourse infrastructure remains intact.

The show followed twenty-one contestants, known as housemates, who were isolated from the outside world for an extended period of time in a custom built House. Each week, one or more of the housemates were evicted by a public vote. The last remaining housemate, Josie Gibson, was declared the winner, winning a cash prize of £100,000 and a place in a special edition of the show named Ultimate Big Brother, which began immediately after the conclusion of this series. It launched on 9 June 2010 and ended on 24 August 2010, lasting 77 days - the shortest run since the fifth series in 2004. Davina McCall returned as presenter for the eleventh and final time. Fourteen housemates entered on launch night, with seven additional housemate being introduced in later weeks. The series was watched by an average of 3 million viewers. Following Channel 4's decision in 2009 not to renew their contract with Endemol to show the series, Channel 5 bought the rights to Big Brother in the United Kingdom, where it was broadcast from 18 August 2011, Big Brother was axed again on 5 November 2018. passages: London: Londinium was founded by the Romans .

Since it was first awarded to Arthur Rose Eldred on August 21, 1912, Eagle Scout has been earned by more than two million youth. The list below includes notable recipients. As of 2014[update], requirements include earning at least 21 merit badges and demonstrating Scout Spirit, leadership, and service. The requirements include an Eagle Scout Service Project where the Scout must further demonstrate service and leadership. Eagle Scouts are recognized with a medal and a cloth badge that visibly recognizes the accomplishments of the Scout. Eagle Palms are a further recognition, awarded for completing additional tenure, leadership, and merit badge requirements. Typically adult volunteers who have received the Eagle award as a youth wear a smaller patch depicting a square knot. The Distinguished Eagle Scout Award (DESA) is bestowed to Eagle Scouts for nationally renowned distinguished service in their profession and to the community for a period of at least 25 years after earning the Eagle Scout rank. Since its introduction in 1969 by the National Eagle Scout Association, the DESA has been awarded to just under 2000 Eagle Scouts. [a]\n The NESA Outstanding Eagle Scout Award (NOESA) is bestowed to Eagle Scouts who have distinguished themselves at a local-to-regional level or who have not yet met the 25-year tenure requirement to be considered for a DESA. This award was introduced in 2011. passages: ", "label": "1960 c"}

It has been estimated that there are at least 31,460 freshwater lochs in Scotland and that 1.9% of the land surface is covered by fresh waters. The distribution has a north west to south east gradient with the highest concentrations occurring in the islands of the Outer Hebrides. [Note 1]\n The more notable freshwater islands include Lochindorb Castle Island, Loch Leven Castle Island, St Serf's Inch, and Inchmahome, each of which have had a role to play in Scottish history. Inchmurrin, the largest freshwater island in the British Isles, is in Loch Lomond, which contains thirty or more other islands. [Note 2]\n Various names are used repeatedly. Inch or Innis is a Scots word that can mean island (although it is also used for terra firma surrounded by marsh). Similarly, Eilean is the Gaelic for island. -holm is a common suffix for offshore islands in the north of Scotland and is derived from the Old Norse holmr, meaning a small and rounded islet. This list excludes artificial crannógs and the numerous small freshwater islands with no recorded name.

The titles in bold were the five nominated films, which came from Belgium, Germany, Russia, Uruguay and the eventual winner, Indochina, from France. The film A Place in the World submitted by Uruguay, was disqualified after the nominations were announced in early 1993, when it was discovered that the film was an overwhelmingly Argentine production with minimal input from Uruguayans. Argentina had selected another film to compete for the award, so director Adolfo Aristarain asked Uruguay (which had never entered the competition before) to submit it instead. The Argentine film did not get nominated. The A Place in the World was removed from the ballot (leaving only four films in contention for the award), leading the director to sue the Academy. For the first time films from the former USSR competed against each other in this category; Estonia, Kazakhstan, Latvia and the Russian Federation submitted their first-ever films. After being disqualified the previous year since the country was not yet internationally recognized, Croatia had a film accepted for the first time. passages: Eliseo Subiela: His works are considered to be in the 'magic realism ' genre .

The honor was first given 33 years ago in 1987 to the outstanding player in the division, but in 1995, eligibility was restricted to offensive players, as the Buck Buchanan Award for defensive players was inaugurated. The award was named in honor of the late National Football League (NFL) legend Walter Payton, who starred at Jackson State University in the early 1970s. Among the many schools in the division, only nine have claimed more than one award, and only seven have had more than one player win the award. Eastern Washington and Villanova had three players win the award, and five have had two players win: Colgate, Georgia Southern, Idaho, New Hampshire, and Eastern Illinois. Two players have won the award twice, with both being the only players from their institutions to win. In 2009, Armanti Edwards from Appalachian State became the first to receive the award twice, followed in 2017 by Jeremiah Briscoe from Sam Houston State. The most recent winner, Trey Lance of North Dakota State in 2019, is the first freshman ever to receive the award. passages: Jimmy Garoppolo: His second season with San Francisco ended prematurely after he tore his ACL in Week 3 of the 2018 season . | Brian Westbrook: He was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the third round of the 2002 NFL Draft after playing college football for Villanova University . | ", "label": "49ers"}

Endorsements of statesmen and celebrities are also important to candidates. Late in the Republican race cycle, Romney toured Israel and Poland after a visit to the London 2012 Olympics. He received the endorsement of former President of Poland Lech Wałęsa, and soon after, the endorsement of actor and Second Amendment proponent Clint Eastwood. The winning of endorsements, also known as the Endorsement Race or Endorsement Derby, is argued to be a vital feature of the United States presidential race and the political party system.

It became part of the Eclipse Awards program in 1971. The award originated in 1936 when both the Daily Racing Form (DRF) and Turf and Sports Digest (TSD) magazine began naming an annual champion. Starting in 1950, the Thoroughbred Racing Associations (TRA) began naming its own champion. The following list provides the name of the horses chosen by both of these organizations. There were several disagreements, with more than one champion being recognized on seven occasions. The Daily Racing Form, the Thoroughbred Racing Associations, and the National Turf Writers Association all joined forces in 1971 to create the Eclipse Award. In 1978, the voting resulted in a tie between two fillies. Champions from 1887 through 1935 were selected retrospectively by a panel of experts as published by The Blood-Horse magazine. passages: James W.

The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. Due to the nature of this medal, it is commonly presented posthumously. Although Medals of Honor can be awarded only to members of the U.S. armed forces, being a U.S. citizen is not a prerequisite for eligibility to receive the medal. Since the American Civil War, hundreds of people born outside the United States have received the medal, the most recent of these recipients being Pedro Cano and Jesus S. Duran who received their medals in March 2014 for actions performed during World War II and the Vietnam War respectively. The large number of foreign-born recipients during the 19th and early 20th centuries was mostly due to immigration waves from Europe. passages: Bosnia and Herzegovina: Sarajevo is the capital and largest city .

The award was given only to the album producer, and to the composer and lyricist who wrote at least 51% of the music which had not been recorded previously. Over the years, the qualifications for the individual nominees has fluctuated with principal artists, composers, and producers at one point being the sole eligible nominee, to the more recent standard which includes those whose contributions accounted for the majority of the album. As of 2012, the award description is as follows: Award to the principal vocalist(s) and the album producer(s) of 51% or more playing time of the album. The lyricist(s) and composer(s) of a new score are eligible for an Award if they have written and/or composed a new score which comprises 51% or more playing time of the album. Therefore, composers and lyricists are ineligible when recordings contain a majority of previously released material (revivals, collected works). Also, while they are not listed among the nominees, since 2001 the Recording Academy has awarded an official Grammy to the engineers/mixers of the winning Album. Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were handed out, for music released in the previous year. As of 2008, the current eligibility year is defined by the Recording Academy as beginning October 1, and ending the following September 30. Awards are given in February following the eligibility period. passages: Jerry Ragavoy: Jordan Jerry Ragovoy ( September 4 , 1930 - July 13 , 2011 ) was an American songwriter and record producer .

The capital of the province is Guangzhou. With a population of 113.46 million (as of 2018) across a total area of about 179,800 km2 (69,400 sq mi), Guangdong is the most populous province of China and the 15th-largest by area. Its economy is larger than that of any other province in the nation and the 6th largest sub-national economy in the world with a GDP size of 1.47 trillion US dollars (9.73 trillion Chinese yuan) in 2018. The Pearl River Delta Economic Zone, a Chinese megalopolis, is a core for high technology, manufacturing and foreign trade. Located in this zone are two of the four top Chinese cities and the top two Chinese prefecture-level cities by GDP; Guangzhou, the capital of the province, and Shenzhen, the first special economic zone in the country. These two are among the most populous and important cities in China, and have now become two of the world's most populous megacities. The province of Guangdong surpassed Henan and Shandong to become the most populous province in China in January 2005, registering 79.1 million permanent residents and 31 million migrants who lived in the province for at least six months of the year; the total population was 104,303,132 in the 2010 census, accounting for 7.79 percent of Mainland China's population. This makes it the most populous first-level administrative subdivision of any country outside of South Asia, as its population is surpassed only by those of the Pakistani province of Punjab and the Indian states of Bihar, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. Its population increase since the census has been modest, the province registering 108,500,000 people in 2015.

They are currently members of the North Division of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the National Football League (NFL), and are the third-oldest franchise in the NFL. Founded in 1919 by coach, player, and future Hall of Fame inductee Curly Lambeau and sports and telegraph editor George Whitney Calhoun, the Packers organization has become one of the most successful professional football teams, having won a total of 13 professional American football championships - nine NFL Championships and four Super Bowls - the most in the NFL. The franchise has recorded 18 NFL divisional titles, eight NFL conference championships, and the second most regular season and overall victories of any NFL franchise, behind the Chicago Bears. In 1963, the Pro Football Hall of Fame was created to honor the history of professional American football and the individuals who have greatly influenced it. Since the charter induction class of 1963, 31 individuals who have played or coached for the Packers have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Of the 30 inductees, 25 made their primary contribution to football with the Packers, while five only contributed a minor portion of their career to the Packers and two were assistant coaches. Of the original 17 individuals inducted in 1963, four spent the major part of their career with the Green Bay Packers. This includes the founder Curly Lambeau, the NFL's all-time offensive tackle Cal Hubbard, the 1941 and 1942 Most Valuable Player Don Hutson, and 1931 All-NFL player Johnny (Blood) McNally. The first two decades of the Hall of Fame's existence saw 17 Packers enshrined, including one inductee who was not a player for the Packers, Vince Lombardi. Coaching the Packers from 1959 to 1967, Lombardi led the team to five NFL Championships, plus winning the first two Super Bowls against the American Football League, and an overall winning percentage of .754. The most recent Packer to be inducted was Jerry Kramer in 2018. passages: Clarke Hinkle: Known as one of the toughest players in the era of iron man football , Hinkle played for the Green Bay Packers from 1932 to 1941 and held the all-time National Football League ( NFL ) records for rushing yardage and carries when his playing career ended .

The win, Prost's third for the season, closed the gap to championship points leader Senna to just three points. passages: ", "label": "1:07.232"}

Its alumni include politicians, lawyers, bishops, poets, and academics. Some went on to become fellows of the college; 14 students later became principal of the college. It was founded in 1571 by Queen Elizabeth I, at the request of a Welsh clergyman, Hugh Price, who was Treasurer of St David's Cathedral in Pembrokeshire. The college still has strong links with Wales, and about 15% of students are Welsh. There are 340 undergraduates and 190 students carrying out postgraduate studies. Old members of Jesus College are sometimes known as Jesubites. From the world of politics, the college's alumni include two Prime Ministers (Harold Wilson of Britain and Norman Manley of Jamaica), one Speaker of the House of Commons (Sir William Williams), a co-founder of Plaid Cymru (D. J. Williams) and a co-founder of the African National Congress (Pixley ka Isaka Seme). Members of Parliament from the three main political parties in the United Kingdom have attended the college, as have politicians from Australia (Neal Blewett), New Zealand (Harold Rushworth), Sri Lanka (Lalith Athulathmudali) and the United States (Heather Wilson). The list of lawyers include one Lord Chancellor (Lord Sankey) and one Law Lord (Lord du Parcq). The list of clergy includes three Archbishops of Wales (A. G. Edwards, Glyn Simon and Gwilym Williams). Celticists associated with the college include Sir John Morris-Jones, Sir Thomas (T. H.)

Guildford Cathedral , where Alex Wedderspoon was Dean from 1987 to 2001 | Jesus College is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in England. The college was founded in 1571 by Queen Elizabeth I at the request of Hugh Price, a Welsh clergyman, who was Treasurer of St David's Cathedral in Pembrokeshire. The college still has strong links with Wales, and about 15% of students are Welsh. There are 340 undergraduates and 190 students carrying out postgraduate studies. Women have been admitted since 1974, when the college was one of the first five men's colleges to become co-educational. Old members of Jesus College are sometimes known as Jesubites. Three Archbishops of Wales have studied at Jesus College. A. G. Edwards, the first archbishop of the Church in Wales after its disestablishment, read Literae Humaniores from 1871 to 1874, and was archbishop from 1920 to 1934. Glyn Simon, a student from 1922 to 1926, was Archbishop of Wales from 1968 to 1971. He was succeeded by Gwilym Williams, who was archbishop from 1971 to 1982.

Listed here are both appearance droughts and winning droughts in almost every level of the NFL playoff system. As of the 2018 NFL season, every active NFL team has qualified for and won a game in the playoffs. Teams that have never made it beyond each successive milestone are listed under the year in which they began NFL play. Of the 12 teams that have never won the Super Bowl, four (4) are expansion franchises younger than the Super Bowl itself (Bengals, Panthers, Jaguars, and the Texans). The Falcons began playing during the season in which the Super Bowl was first played. The seven (7) other clubs (Cardinals, Lions, Oilers/Titans, Chargers, Browns, Bills, and Vikings) all won an NFL or AFL championship prior to the AFL-NFL merger; in the case of the Vikings, however, the Super Bowl existed at the time they won their league title, leaving them and the Falcons as the only two teams to have existed for as long as or longer than the Super Bowl that have never secured the highest championship available to them. The longest drought since a championship of any kind is that of the Cardinals, at 72 seasons. Note that for continuity purposes, the Cleveland Browns are officially considered to have suspended operations for the 1996, 1997, and 1998 seasons. Since returning 21 years ago, they have only made the playoffs once, while the Baltimore Ravens are considered to be a separate team that began play in 1996. The Ravens, as a result of the Cleveland Browns relocation controversy, absorbed the Browns' personnel upon their suspension, but not their history. passages: Super Bowl XLIV: The Saints defeated the Colts by a score of 31-17 , earning their first Super Bowl win .

P-3C Orion MQ-4C Triton . The VP designation is one of the oldest in the U. S. Navy and is the oldest designation currently in use . It first appeared in 1922 to designate `` Seaplane Patrol Squadron '' and from 1924 it has designated `` Patrol Squadron '' . [ 17 ] In 1982 the VPU Patrol Squadron Special Unit designation was created . [ 13 ] Maritime patrol aircraft are used primarily for reconnaissance , anti-surface warfare and anti-submarine warfare . Volume 2 of the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons contains comprehensive histories over 150 patrol squadrons . Its Appendix 7 details the lineage of every VP , VPB , VP ( H ) , and VP ( AM ) squadron from 1922 through the late 1990s . In 2016 the first `` Unmanned '' Patrol Squadron ( VUP ) was established . VUP-19 operates the MQ-4C Triton unmanned air vehicle from an operations center located at NAS Jacksonville while its aircraft with aircraft maintenance personnel are deployed around the world as required . A second VUP squadron is programmed for establishment in 2018 with an operations center at NAS Whidbey Island . When not deployed VP squadrons are home-ported at NAS Jacksonville , FL or NAS Whidbey Island , WA except for VPU-2 which is home-ported at MCAS Kaneohe Bay . | This is a list of active United States Navy aircraft squadrons. Deactivated or disestablished squadrons are listed in the List of Inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons. Navy aircraft squadrons are composed of several aircraft (from as few as about four to as many as about a dozen), the officers who fly them, the officers and sailors who maintain them and administrative support officers and sailors. Some of the units listed in this article are not technically squadrons, but they all operate U.S. Navy aircraft in some capacity. Squadrons and their history are listed in the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons (DANAS). passages: ", "label": "Mad Foxes"}

Events took place at eleven pre-existing venues, twelve new venues constructed for the Olympics, and eight temporary venues that were removed following the games. In addition, six venues outside Beijing hosted events, two of which were newly built for the Olympics. Beijing won its bid to host the 2008 Olympics on 13 July 2001. The first new venues to begin construction were the Beijing National Stadium, Beijing National Aquatics Center, Beijing Shooting Range Hall, and the Laoshan Velodrome, where major work commenced in December 2003. By May 2007, construction had begun at all of the Beijing venues for the games. Approximately RMB¥13 billion (US$1.9 billion) was spent to build and renovate the venues. Several of the venues were located at the Olympic Green Olympic Park. The largest venue at the games in terms of seating capacity was the Beijing National Stadium, also known as the Bird's Nest, which could at the time hold 91,000 spectators and was the site for the opening and closing ceremonies.

This list is in alphabetical order by station or stop name, which mostly corresponds to the city in which it is located. If an English Wikipedia page exists for the actual station or stop, a link is included. Some Thruway Motorcoach stops include train stations that are not served by Amtrak trains (and occasionally any trains at all). All current (and most former) Amtrak train stops (stations) and Thruway Motorcoach stops have a three-letter station code (sometimes also referred to as a city code). These codes do not necessarily correspond with the list of IATA-indexed train stations or the three-character IATA airport codes, although many are the same. Amtrak began using station codes in 1992, so stations closed or removed from all Amtrak service prior to 1992 will not have had a station code assigned. The station code ENP is used for any stop en route, not otherwise specified. [citation needed] If a station code was used by more than one train station, each station is listed. However, if a station code was used for a Thruway Motorcoach stop that has changed locations, only information for the current location (or most recent location, if the stop is no longer in service) is included in the notes, unless one of the locations was an actual train station. Ridership data and station ownership is from Amtrak's Great American Stations website. [Note 1] The ownership of many stations is shared, with one entity owning one or more of the following: the facility itself, the parking lot, the passenger platform, and the train tracks. passages: Appleton, Wisconsin: Appleton is a city in Outagamie ( mostly ) , Calumet , and Winnebago counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin .

into Tau Kappa Epsilon (TKE) Fraternity. The fraternity was founded by the five men of Joseph Lorenzo Settles, James Carson McNutt, Clarence Arthur Mayer, Owen Ison Truitt, and Charles Roy Atkinson on January 10, 1899, at Illinois Wesleyan University in Bloomington, Illinois. Members traditionally initiate into a chapter during their collegiate career, although honorary members may not necessary have attended a university or college. The list of Tau Kappa Epsilon brothers spans over multiple careers including politics, business, athletics, and entertainment. Among the most recognized include U.S. President Ronald Reagan who was the recipient of the Order of the Golden Eagle, the fraternity's highest honor. Other widely recognized political figures include former West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd, who at the time of his death was the longest-serving member in the history of the United States Congress, and former Arkansas Governor and Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, who while running for president launched a TKE-specific website and visited Tekes on the campaign trail. Dozens of top CEOs and university presidents have also made the list such as Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, and Steve Forbes of Forbes magazine, who was the fraternity's 250,000th initiate. Numerous athletic and music superstars are also Tekes including NFL quarterbacks Terry Bradshaw, Phil Simms, and Aaron Rodgers, Olympians Douglas Blubaugh, Sim Iness, and Johnny Quinn, and singers Elvis Presley, Willie Nelson, and the Everly Brothers. passages: Super Bowl IX: Led by quarterback Terry Bradshaw and the Steel Curtain defense , the Steelers advanced to their first Super Bowl after posting a 10-3-1 regular season record and playoff victories over the Buffalo Bills and the Oakland Raiders .

In her modeling career and early film roles, she used the names Jamie King and James King, which was a childhood nickname given to King by her parents, because her agency already represented another Jaime - the older, then-more famous model Jaime Rishar. A successful model, King was discovered at age 14 in 1993 and appeared in Vogue, Mademoiselle and Harper's Bazaar, among other fashion magazines. From 1998, she moved into acting, taking small film roles. Her first major role was in Pearl Harbor (2001) and her first starring movie role was in Bulletproof Monk (2003). She has since appeared in other films including Sin City (2005) and My Bloody Valentine 3D (2009) and, from 2011 to 2015, starred in the television series Hart of Dixie. In 2016, she had the lead role in The Mistletoe Promise, a Hallmark movie.

Electoral Court website : [ 1 ] | The Brazilian gubernatorial elections, 2010 will be held on Sunday, October 3, as part of the country's general election. In these elections, all 26 Brazilian states and the Federal District governorships will be up for election. If none of the candidates receives more than a half of the valid votes, a run-off will be held on October 24, 2010. According to the Federal Constitution, Governors are elected directly to a four-year term, with a limit of two terms. Eleven governors are prohibited from seeking re-election. Currently, ten of the total seats are held by the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), followed by five held by the Workers' Party (PT) and the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) each. The Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB) holds three seats, and the Progressive Party (PP) holds two. The Democratic Labour Party (PDT) and the Republic Party (PR) holds one seat each. Some Governors are not the same from the outcome of the previous election, since some of them had their terms repealed by the Supreme Electoral Court. These elections will coincide with the presidential election, as well as the elections for Legislative Assemblies and both houses of the National Congress. These will be the 8th direct gubernatorial elections, and the sixth since the end of the military dictatorship. passages: Workers' Party (Brazil): Both parties generally prohibit any kind of coalition or official cooperation with each other . Despite its relatively large number of supporters , the party has been involved in a number of corruption scandals since Lula first came to power and saw its popular support plummet between 2010 and 2016 , with presidential approval ratings falling from over 80% to 9% . | Brazilian Social Democracy Party: The Brazilian Social Democracy Party ( Portuguese : Partido da Social Democracia Brasileira , PSDB ) , also known as the Brazilian Social Democratic Party or the Party of Brazilian Social Democracy , is a centrist political party in Brazil . As the third largest party in the National Congress , the PSDB was the main opposition party against the left-wing Workers ' Party ( PT ) administrations of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff from 2003 to 2016 . | Alfredo Nascimento (politician): Alfredo Nascimento ( born May 5 , 1952 ) is Brazil 's minister of Transport . He is a member of the Republic Party , and was the party 's president until he resigned in 2016 in support of the Impeachment process against Dilma Rousseff . | Sérgio Cabral Filho: Cabral was selected to make formal apologies to 120 individuals , including Dilma Rousseff , Brazil 's 36th president , for human rights abuses inflicted on them during the dictatorship that was in power in Brazil from 1964 to 1985 . | Christian Labour Party: After Collor 's impeachment in 1992 the party suffered a deep crisis and eventually changed its name to Partido Trabalhista Cristão in 2000 . In 2016 Collor de Mello ( now a senator ) re-joined PTC , which thus regained parliamentary representation . | ", "label": "2016"}

It was first held in 1946 and, having taken place every year since then, it is Japan's oldest annual marathon race. The early editions of the race were held in Osaka until a switch to Tokyo occurred for the 1963-64 marathons, and all subsequent races thereafter were held in Shiga Prefecture, starting in Ōtsu fronting Lake Biwa, where the race gets its name. It is sponsored by Mainichi and was known simply as the Mainichi Marathon for a period. The race begins and ends at the Ojiyama Stadium. The Lake Biwa Marathon has been selected as the Japanese national marathon championships on dozens of occasions, starting in 1960.

In the beginning, only countries within the Commonwealth could join. These members were then joined by India, New Zealand, and the West Indies in 1926 and later by Pakistan in 1953. In 1961, South Africa resigned due to their leaving the Commonwealth, but they continued to play Test cricket until their international exile in 1970. The Imperial Cricket Conference was renamed the International Cricket Conference in 1965, with new rules permitting countries from outside the Commonwealth to be elected into the governing body for the first time. That year, Fiji and the USA became the first Associate Member nations. In 1981, Sri Lanka became the first Associate Member to be elected a Full Member, returning the number of Test-playing nations to seven. In 1989, the ICC was again renamed, this time to International Cricket Council. South Africa was reelected as a Full Member to the ICC in 1991 and Zimbabwe was elected in 1992. It would be eight years before the next Full Member, Bangladesh, was elected in 2000.

There is an organization known as the Columbia County Covered Bridges Association that has existed since 1991 and supports the presence of covered bridges in the county. The county commissioner of Columbia County, Chris Young, is also a supporter of Columbia County's covered bridges, stating that When you stand on a covered bridge, you're actually going back in time. 18 of the covered bridges are open to vehicle traffic, as of 2002, and these are maintained by officials of Columbia County. The remainder of the bridges are maintained by the Columbia County Covered Bridges Association. A number of the covered bridges are attractions for local and regional tourism. They are also used for picnics and fishing. A number of the covered bridges were damaged during Tropical Storm Lee in 2011. passages: Josiah Hess Covered Bridge No. 122: 122 is a historic wooden covered bridge over Huntington Creek in Fishing Creek Township in Columbia County , Pennsylvania .
