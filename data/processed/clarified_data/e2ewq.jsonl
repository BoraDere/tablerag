It also lists the coach associated with the team for each respective year. The table highlights the team's performance fluctuations over the years, as well as coaching changes.\n\n**Data Patterns and Trends**: The table indicates a strong performance in the early years, particularly in 1910 with 11 wins and only 1 loss, and a championship finish in 1913. However, there is a notable decline in performance starting in 1916 with only 2 wins, leading to a particularly poor showing in 1920 and 1921 where the team recorded no wins. The coaching stability is evident, with Earl Ball coaching for several years in the early part of the record, followed by a transition to Cooney Checkaye in the 1920s. The year 1918 shows a complete lack of play, which may indicate a disruption, possibly due to external factors such as World War I.

Five men came out and tried to drive it away. The wolf charged at Diamond Jenness after he threw a rock and missed. Jenness grabbed the wolf by the back of the neck, but the wolf turned its head enough to severely bite his forearm. He choked the wolf with his other hand; it released, stepped back, and was shot by another man. The wound was treated and eventually fully healed, but Jenness never contracted rabies despite consistency of the wolf\u2019s behavior with the early stages of the disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                      |\n| Mike Dusiac, Railwayman                                |         | \u2642        | December 29, 1942       | Possibly rabid                | Poulin, Ontario, Canada                                                                       | Riding a small rail vehicle called a speeder when a wolf leaped at him and bit his sleeve, knocking him down and knocking the vehicle off the track. Dusiac kept the wolf at bay for more than 25 minutes with an ax. He managed to hit the wolf repeatedly but not squarely enough. The wolf was not deterred by an approaching train which stopped to help Dusiac. Several railwaymen came running, but the wolf would not retreat. The men killed the wolf with picks and shovels. The carcass was inspected by a biologist, and it appeared healthy. However, Rutter and Pimlot reviewed the case in 1968 and concluded that it must have been rabid because of the sustained and determined nature of the attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                      |\n| Zacarias Hugo                                          | 14      | \u2642        | 1943                    | Possibly rabid                | Etivluk River, Alaska, USA                                                                    | While hunting caribou, Zacarias heard a sound, turned and saw a large black wolf coming for him. It knocked him down and bit his arm, so he could not use his rifle. It bit his legs, back, arm and neck and dragged him 18 metres before abandoning the attack and disappearing. He walked back to camp, but had lost a lot of blood, mostly from his forearm. His caribou skin Anorak protected him from greater injury or even death, but may have contributed to the attack if it caused the wolf to mistake him for a caribou. This attack had long been classified as \"rabid\" because it occurred during an epizootic of the disease in that area and because Zac's father, Inualuruk, tracked the wolf and observed to have been walking at times in the splayed manner of a sick animal. However, neither the fact that the attack was abandoned in the way it was, nor the fact that Zacarias never developed the disease is not consistent with rabies. |                      |\n| Thomas Hamilton                                        |         | \u2642        | 1950                    | Prey-testing agonistic charge | Lower Foster Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada                                                       | While out hunting wolves, he laid down to aim his rifle, when the wolves arose and started running at him.

Mulders then took the collar and struck the wolf in the head twice and stabbed it in the chest with a knife. The bite tore open his pants but left only a small wound.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                      |\n| Park visitors                                          |         |          | 1987-1998               |                               | Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada                                                    | All incidents were proceeded by extensive habituation.

Deaths, and Population Changes from 1900 to 2013\n\n**Keywords**: Average population, live births, deaths, natural change, crude birth rate, crude death rate, fertility rates\n\n**Content Overview**: This table presents demographic data over a span of more than a century, from 1900 to 2013. The key fields include average population (in thousands), live births, deaths, natural change (the difference between births and deaths), crude birth rate (births per 1000 people), crude death rate (deaths per 1000 people), and fertility rates. The table allows for the analysis of population dynamics, fertility trends, and mortality rates over time.\n\n**Data Patterns and Trends**: The data reveals several notable trends:\n- A general increase in average population from 18,520 in 1900 to 46,818 in 2012, indicating significant population growth over the century.\n- The crude birth rate peaked in the early 1900s, with a gradual decline observed towards the end of the 20th century, reflecting changing societal norms and family planning practices.\n- Death rates have shown a declining trend from the early 1900s, particularly after the mid-20th century, likely due to advancements in healthcare and living conditions.\n- Natural change fluctuated significantly, with some years, especially during the early 1900s, showing high natural increases, while 1918 marked a notable decline due to increased deaths, possibly linked to the influenza pandemic.\n- Fertility rates generally decreased over the decades, reaching a low of 1.29 by 2013, indicating a shift towards smaller family sizes and possibly improved access to contraception and education for women.\n\nOverall, the table encapsulates the demographic transition experienced over more than a century, highlighting shifts in birth and death rates and the implications for population growth.", "terms_explanation": "### Term Explanations for the Historical Demographic Trends Table\n\n**1.

Counties and Zip Codes in Pennsylvania\n\n**Keywords**: Place name, number of counties, principal county, lower zip code, upper zip code\n\n**Content Overview**: This table presents a detailed list of various places in Pennsylvania, each associated with a single principal county and specific zip codes. The data is structured with columns for the name of the place, the number of counties it belongs to (always one), the principal county, and the respective lower and upper zip codes.

Editions\n\n**Keywords**: Server specifications, licensing model, processor limits, memory limits, user limits, virtualization rights, Active Directory services\n\n**Content Overview**: This table presents a detailed comparison of server specifications and licensing models across various editions, including Foundation, Essentials, Standard, and Datacenter. It outlines key parameters such as licensing model, processor chip limits, memory limits, user limits, and various service roles (e.g., DHCP, DNS, Active Directory). Each edition's capabilities and restrictions are clearly delineated, allowing for easy comparison of features and limits.\n\n**Data Patterns and Trends**: The table reveals a trend where the Standard and Datacenter editions offer significantly more flexibility and capacity compared to the Foundation and Essentials editions. For instance, both Standard and Datacenter allow for unlimited users and extensive memory limits (up to 4 TB). In contrast, the Foundation and Essentials editions are more restrictive, with user limits of 15 and 25 respectively and lower memory capacities. Additionally, the Datacenter edition is characterized by its support for unlimited virtualization rights, indicating a focus on enterprise-level deployment.", "terms_explanation": "**Term Explanations**:\n\n**1.
