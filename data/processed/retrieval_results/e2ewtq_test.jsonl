It includes key data fields such as the time taken to complete the race, wind conditions, any automatic timing used, the athlete's name and nationality, the location of the race, and the date of the event. The data provides insights into the progression of sprinting times and conditions over the years.\n\n**Data Patterns and Trends**: The table shows a consistent performance level around the 20.6-second mark for many athletes, with notable improvements over time, particularly in the late 1960s. Wind conditions varied, with some performances recorded under favorable conditions (0.0 m/s), while others faced headwinds (e.g., -1.6 m/s). The emergence of athletes like Tommie Smith and Donald Quarrie in the late 1960s and early 1970s is significant, as they achieved times below 20 seconds, indicating a shift towards faster sprinting capabilities. The data also highlights multiple performances by the same athletes, suggesting their dominance in the sport during this period.\nterms_explanation: **Term Explanations**:\n\n**1. 200-Meter Sprint**\n- **Definition**: A short-distance running event where athletes race over a distance of 200 meters, typically held on a track.\n- **Synonyms and Related Concepts**: 200m dash, sprint race, short-distance race.\n- **Query Suggestions**:\n  1. \"What are the historical records for the 200-meter sprint from 1951 to 1975?\"\n  2. \"How has the performance in the 200-meter sprint evolved over the years?\"\n  3. \"Who are the notable athletes in the 200-meter sprint during this period?\"\n\n**2.
