(km\u00b2), area (sq mi), country or region\n\n**Content Overview**: This table ranks various islands based on their area, providing data in both square kilometers (km\u00b2) and square miles (sq mi). Each entry includes the rank of the island, its name, the area in both measurement units, and the corresponding country or region. The table serves to compare the sizes of different islands across multiple countries in Europe and surrounding regions.\n\n**Data Patterns and Trends**: The table lists islands with areas ranging from 50 km\u00b2 to 100 km\u00b2, highlighting a diverse set of countries including Greece, Norway, Croatia, and others. Many of the islands have similar sizes, with several entries at 95 km\u00b2 or 96 km\u00b2. Greece features prominently in the list, indicating a concentration of islands within a relatively small area. The data suggests that the islands vary not only in size but also in their geographical distribution across Europe.\nterms_explanation: **Term Explanations for the \"Ranking of Islands by Area in Square Kilometers and Square Miles\" Table**\n\n---\n\n**1.
