The table outlines various players who were undrafted in 2010, detailing their positions, colleges, and notes on their time with the Broncos. Many of these players faced early releases or were assigned to practice squads, indicating a challenging path to securing a spot on the active roster. This aligns with the broader context of NFL team dynamics, where undrafted players often struggle to make lasting impressions in a highly competitive environment.\"\n}", "table_context": ""}]}

Reedfish and birchirs are now separated from the Chondrostei into their own sister lineage, the Cladistia.

This group had once been classified with the sharks: the similarities are obvious, as not only do the chondrosteans mostly lack bone, but the structure of the jaw is more akin to that of sharks than other bony fish, and both lack scales (excluding the Polypteriforms). Additional shared features include spiracles and, in sturgeons, a heterocercal tail (the vertebrae extend into the larger lobe of the caudal fin).
