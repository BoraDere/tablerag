It also lists the coach associated with the team for each respective year. The table highlights the team's performance fluctuations over the years, as well as coaching changes.\n\n**Data Patterns and Trends**: The table indicates a strong performance in the early years, particularly in 1910 with 11 wins and only 1 loss, and a championship finish in 1913. However, there is a notable decline in performance starting in 1916 with only 2 wins, leading to a particularly poor showing in 1920 and 1921 where the team recorded no wins. The coaching stability is evident, with Earl Ball coaching for several years in the early part of the record, followed by a transition to Cooney Checkaye in the 1920s. The year 1918 shows a complete lack of play, which may indicate a disruption, possibly due to external factors such as World War I. Overall, the team's performance shows a significant variability, reflecting the challenges and changes faced over the 16-year span.\nterms_explanation: **Term Explanations**:\n\n**1.

Five men came out and tried to drive it away. The wolf charged at Diamond Jenness after he threw a rock and missed. Jenness grabbed the wolf by the back of the neck, but the wolf turned its head enough to severely bite his forearm. He choked the wolf with his other hand; it released, stepped back, and was shot by another man. The wound was treated and eventually fully healed, but Jenness never contracted rabies despite consistency of the wolf\u2019s behavior with the early stages of the disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                      |\n| Mike Dusiac, Railwayman                                |         | \u2642        | December 29, 1942       | Possibly rabid                | Poulin, Ontario, Canada                                                                       | Riding a small rail vehicle called a speeder when a wolf leaped at him and bit his sleeve, knocking him down and knocking the vehicle off the track. Dusiac kept the wolf at bay for more than 25 minutes with an ax. He managed to hit the wolf repeatedly but not squarely enough. The wolf was not deterred by an approaching train which stopped to help Dusiac. Several railwaymen came running, but the wolf would not retreat. The men killed the wolf with picks and shovels. The carcass was inspected by a biologist, and it appeared healthy. However, Rutter and Pimlot reviewed the case in 1968 and concluded that it must have been rabid because of the sustained and determined nature of the attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                      |\n| Zacarias Hugo                                          | 14      | \u2642        | 1943                    | Possibly rabid                | Etivluk River, Alaska, USA                                                                    | While hunting caribou, Zacarias heard a sound, turned and saw a large black wolf coming for him. It knocked him down and bit his arm, so he could not use his rifle. It bit his legs, back, arm and neck and dragged him 18 metres before abandoning the attack and disappearing. He walked back to camp, but had lost a lot of blood, mostly from his forearm. His caribou skin Anorak protected him from greater injury or even death, but may have contributed to the attack if it caused the wolf to mistake him for a caribou. This attack had long been classified as \"rabid\" because it occurred during an epizootic of the disease in that area and because Zac's father, Inualuruk, tracked the wolf and observed to have been walking at times in the splayed manner of a sick animal. However, neither the fact that the attack was abandoned in the way it was, nor the fact that Zacarias never developed the disease is not consistent with rabies. |                      |\n| Thomas Hamilton                                        |         | \u2642        | 1950                    | Prey-testing agonistic charge | Lower Foster Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada                                                       | While out hunting wolves, he laid down to aim his rifle, when the wolves arose and started running at him.

Mulders then took the collar and struck the wolf in the head twice and stabbed it in the chest with a knife. The bite tore open his pants but left only a small wound.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                      |\n| Park visitors                                          |         |          | 1987-1998               |                               | Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada                                                    | All incidents were proceeded by extensive habituation.
