It lists the river's source and mouth locations, both of which are situated in Texas, along with their respective elevations and coordinates. The table also includes the river's total length and basin area, as well as average, maximum, and minimum discharge rates. This information is essential for understanding the river's characteristics and its significance within the Texas landscape.\n\n**Data Patterns and Trends**: The Brazos River stretches approximately 1,352 km (840 miles) and encompasses a basin area of 116,000 km\u00b2 (44,788 sq mi). The average discharge at Rosharon, TX, is noted to be 237.5 m\u00b3\/s (8,387 cu ft\/s), while it can peak at a maximum of 2,390 m\u00b3\/s (84,402 cu ft\/s) and drop to a minimum of 0.76 m\u00b3\/s (27 cu ft\/s). The elevation at the river's source is 453 m (1,486 ft), while it reaches sea level (0 m) at its mouth in the Gulf of Mexico. This data indicates the river's significant hydrological variability and its role in the regional ecosystem.\nterms_explanation: **Term Explanations**:\n\n**1. Brazos River**\n- **Definition**: The Brazos River is a major river in Texas, United States, known for its significant length and hydrological characteristics. It flows from its source in the Llano Estacado region to its mouth at the Gulf of Mexico.\n- **Synonyms and Related Concepts**: Brazos, Brazos River Basin, Texas River.\n- **Query Suggestions**:\n  1. \"What is the total length of the Brazos River as listed in the table?\"\n  2. \"Where does the Brazos River originate and where does it flow into?\"\n  3. \"What are the key geographical features of the Brazos River according to the table?\"\n\n**2. Discharge**\n- **Definition**: Discharge refers to the volume of water that flows through a river or stream at a given time, typically measured in cubic meters per second (m\u00b3\/s) or cubic feet per second (cu ft\/s).\n- **Synonyms and Related Concepts**: Flow rate, streamflow, water discharge.\n- **Query Suggestions**:\n  1. \"What is the average discharge of the Brazos River at Rosharon, TX?\"\n  2. \"How does the maximum discharge of the Brazos River compare to its minimum discharge?\"\n  3. \"What factors influence the discharge rates of the Brazos River?\"\n\n**3. Basin**\n- **Definition**: A basin is an area of land where water from rain or melting snow drains into a common outlet, such as a river. The Brazos River basin encompasses the land area that contributes water to the river.\n- **Synonyms and Related Concepts**: Watershed, drainage basin, catchment area.\n- **Query Suggestions**:\n  1. \"What is the total area of the Brazos River basin as provided in the table?\"\n  2. \"How does the size of the Brazos River basin compare to other river basins in Texas?\"\n  3. \"What are the environmental implications of the Brazos River basin's size?\"\n\n**4. Elevation**\n- **Definition**: Elevation refers to the height of a geographic location above a reference point, usually sea level. For the Brazos River, it indicates the altitude at its source and mouth.\n- **Synonyms and Related Concepts**: Altitude, height, ground level.\n- **Query Suggestions**:\nquery_suggestions: 1. \"What is the total length of the Brazos River?\"\n2. \"At what elevation does the Brazos River begin, and where does it end?\"\n3. \"Can you provide the coordinates for the mouth of the Brazos River?\"\n4. \"What is the average discharge rate of the Brazos River at Rosharon, TX?\"\n5. \"How large is the basin area of the Brazos River?\"\n",

(2011 Census)\n\n**Keywords**: Population, rank, state, union territory, decadal growth, rural population, urban population, area, density, sex ratio, 2011 Census\n\n**Content Overview**: This table presents detailed population statistics for each state and union territory of India based on the 2011 Census. It includes data fields such as rank, name of the state or union territory, total population (with percentage of India's total), decadal growth rate from 2001 to 2011, rural and urban population percentages, total area, population density, and sex ratio. The table serves to compare demographic and geographic characteristics across the various regions of India.\n\n**Data Patterns and Trends**: The data reveals that Uttar Pradesh has the highest population, accounting for 16.49% of India's total population, while states like Sikkim and Lakshadweep have significantly smaller populations. A notable trend is that states with larger populations, such as Bihar and West Bengal, also show substantial rural populations, indicating a correlation between population size and rural demographic. The urban population percentages vary widely, with Delhi having a remarkably high urban population (97.5%), while several northeastern states exhibit higher rural populations. The table also indicates differences in population density, with Delhi having the highest density at 11,297\/km\u00b2, contrasting with states like Arunachal Pradesh and Dadra and Nagar Haveli, which have much lower densities. Overall, the data highlights significant regional disparities in population distribution and urbanization across India.\nterms_explanation: **Term Explanations**:\n\n**1.

Each row details the election year, the winning candidate and their vote count along with the percentage of votes received, the losing candidate with their corresponding vote count and percentage, any other national candidates, their votes and percentages, the total electoral votes awarded, and additional notes where applicable. The data illustrates the electoral dynamics and shifts in voter preferences over time in Nebraska.\n\n**Data Patterns and Trends**: The table reveals several notable trends in Nebraska's voting behavior. For instance, Republican candidates have historically dominated the state, winning the majority of elections, particularly in recent decades. The highest percentage of votes for a candidate was achieved by Ronald Reagan in 1984 with 70.55%. Conversely, the lowest percentage of votes for a winning candidate was recorded by Grover Cleveland in 1892 with just 12.46%. The presence of third-party candidates, such as Ross Perot in the 1996 and 1992 elections, indicates moments of significant voter fragmentation. Additionally, the electoral votes awarded to candidates have remained consistent at five throughout the years, reflecting Nebraska's status in the Electoral College.\nterms_explanation: **Term Explanations for the Table on United States Presidential Elections in Nebraska**\n\n**1.
